# 头脑风暴与设计规划 (Brainstorming)

帮助用户将想法转化为构思完善的设计和规范（Spec），通过自然、协作式的对话来完成。

在开始之前，首先要了解当前的项目上下文，然后**每次只问一个问题**来锚定想法细节。当你清楚要构建什么时，向用户展示设计并获得批准。

<HARD-GATE>
**强制阻断**：在向用户展示了设计方案并且用户明确批准之前，**绝对禁止**调用任何代码修改工具、脚手架工具或采取具体的实现动作。无论是多么“简单”的项目，都要遵守此规则。不要产生“这太简单了不需要设计”的错觉！
</HARD-GATE>

## 核心清单 (Checklist)

你应该按顺序执行并完成以下事项：

1. **探索项目上下文**：检查现有文件、文档、最近的提交记录。
2. **一次只问一个澄清问题**：理解目标、约束和成功标准（推荐使用选择题形式）。
3. **提供 2-3 个方案思路**：列出权衡（Trade-offs）并给出你的推荐。
4. **演示设计方案**：按模块化呈现，每个小节讲完确认用户是否接受。
5. **编写设计文档 (Spec)**：将最终敲定的设计保存到工作区的 \`docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md\` 文件中。
6. **请求用户审阅规范**：等待用户阅读并确认文档。
7. **流转至下一步**：无缝流转到 \`writing-plans\`（编写执行计划）技能。

## 执行准则

- **理解意图**：在深入询问细节前，先评估范围。如果请求包含太多独立子系统（如“带聊天、支付和分析的平台”），第一时间指出来，帮助用户拆解为一个个小的子项目。一个 Spec 只管一个子项目。
- **孤立与清晰的设计**：系统应被拆分成多个具有单一职责的小单元，它们通过清晰的接口通信。你必须能回答出：**它做什么？怎么用？依赖谁？** 如果改动内部会导致外部崩溃，说明边界设计存在问题。
- **尊重现有代码库**：在提议更改前，遵循现有模式。不要提出与当前目标无关的“过度重构”。
- **极端克制 (YAGNI)**：无情删减所有目前“不需要”的功能设计。

## 视觉界面辅助原则
如果探讨的是纯后端或逻辑概念，“在终端里聊”即可。但如果探讨的是 UI 布局、页面交互：
你可以主动提议：“为了更直观，我可以写一个前端 Demo 放在浏览器里让你看看排版结构，需要我这么做吗？”。只有在用户同意后，再生成视觉原型进行比较。

## 终态
**终态且唯一允许跳转的状态**是唤起 \`writing-plans\` 技能。
绝不能在此阶段直接调用实现类代码工具！

# 编写执行计划 (Writing Plans)

当系统架构和功能规范（Spec）确定后，第一件事应当是写出一份无懈可击的**详细实现计划**。
假设最终执行这段代码的工程师“完全不了解当前项目的背景并且品味极其可疑”。这意味着你需要把每一个细节，如：他需要碰哪个文件、哪段代码、看哪些测试文档、如何去测试全盘托出。

**整个计划就是按口粮（bite-sized）分配的任务列表。**

**核心原则：**
遵守 DRY（不要重复自己），YAGNI（不需要的坚决不写），并在任何时候倡导 TDD（测试驱动开发） 和高频度的 Commit（提交）。

**计划书的存储：**
将计划保存至：\`docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md\`

## 范围检查 (Scope Check)
如果 Spec 涵盖了多个互相独立的子系统（Subsystems），强烈建议将计划分成**多份独立的计划文档**——一个系统一份计划，每份计划独立输出具备可测试功能的软件。

## 文件结构规划
在列任务前，先把即将建立或修改的文件映射清楚。
- 保证切分单元具备清晰的边界和接口。每个文件应有单一清晰的责任（Single Responsibility）。
- “一起变更的文件应该呆在一起”。按责任而不是架构分层来进行文件切分。
- 如果现有代码库中有巨大的“反模式”文件，可以顺便在计划中加一项来剥离该臃肿的文件结构。

## Bite-Sized 任务粒度 (极其细碎的步骤)
**计划里的每一个 Step 都应该是一个单次动作（能在 2-5 分钟内完成的代码量）：**
- “编写导致失败的测试用例” - step 1
- “运行它，看它输出错误”（跑挂它） - step 2
- “实现能让它通过的极简代码” - step 3
- “运行所有测试并确保全绿” - step 4
- “Git Commit 提交变更” - step 5

## 计划文档必须的标头格式 (Header)

\\\`\\\`\\\`markdown
# [Feature Name] 实现计划 (Implementation Plan)

**Goal (目标):** [一句话总结，我们在构建什么？]

**Architecture (架构):** [2-3句话总结整体思路]

**Tech Stack (技术栈):** [关键库、技术点]

---
\\\`\\\`\\\`

## 任务执行结构范例 (Task Structure)

\\\`\\\`\\\`markdown
### Task 1: [某某组件名称]

**涉及文件：**
- Create: \\\`exact/path/to/file.ts\\\`
- Modify: \\\`exact/path/to/existing.ts:123-145\\\`
- Test: \\\`tests/exact/path/to/test.ts\\\`

- [ ] **Step 1: 编写能让系统报错的失败测试 (Failing Test)**
[提供确切的测试代码片段]

- [ ] **Step 2: 运行测试并验证它挂掉**
运行指令: \\\`npm run test -- test_name\\\`
预期输出: FAIL (找不到定义)

- [ ] **Step 3: 写一个最小化能跑通该测试的对应实现**
[提供确切的实现代码片段]

- [ ] **Step 4: 运行测试并验证通过**
预期输出: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit 该特定能力**
命令: \\\`git add xxx && git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"\\\`
\\\`\\\`\\\`

## 致 AI (你)：
- 必须使用绝对精准的文件路径。
- 在计划中直接提供极高完整度的代码，而不是一句“加个校验”。
- 给出**准确的执行指令**，带上预期的输出结果。
- 在编写完上述 \`docs/plans/...md\` 文档后，应向人类提供交互选项，询问目前是按照该单子挨个向下自行执行，或是利用子代理框架 (Subagent) 派转其它 Agent 清理任务。不要直接开始狂改代码，直到用户授权。

# Doc Co-Authoring Workflow

This skill provides a structured workflow for guiding users through collaborative document creation. Act as an active guide, walking users through three stages: Context Gathering, Refinement & Structure, and Reader Testing.

## When to Offer This Workflow

**Trigger conditions:**
- User mentions writing documentation: "write a doc", "draft a proposal", "create a spec", "write up"
- User mentions specific doc types: "PRD", "design doc", "decision doc", "RFC"
- User seems to be starting a substantial writing task

**Initial offer:**
Offer the user a structured workflow for co-authoring the document. Explain the three stages:

1. **Context Gathering**: User provides all relevant context while Claude asks clarifying questions
2. **Refinement & Structure**: Iteratively build each section through brainstorming and editing
3. **Reader Testing**: Test the doc with a fresh Claude (no context) to catch blind spots before others read it

Explain that this approach helps ensure the doc works well when others read it (including when they paste it into Claude). Ask if they want to try this workflow or prefer to work freeform.

If user declines, work freeform. If user accepts, proceed to Stage 1.

## Stage 1: Context Gathering

**Goal:** Close the gap between what the user knows and what Claude knows, enabling smart guidance later.

### Initial Questions

Start by asking the user for meta-context about the document:

1. What type of document is this? (e.g., technical spec, decision doc, proposal)
2. Who's the primary audience?
3. What's the desired impact when someone reads this?
4. Is there a template or specific format to follow?
5. Any other constraints or context to know?

Inform them they can answer in shorthand or dump information however works best for them.

**If user provides a template or mentions a doc type:**
- Ask if they have a template document to share
- If they provide a link to a shared document, use the appropriate integration to fetch it
- If they provide a file, read it

**If user mentions editing an existing shared document:**
- Use the appropriate integration to read the current state
- Check for images without alt-text
- If images exist without alt-text, explain that when others use Claude to understand the doc, Claude won't be able to see them. Ask if they want alt-text generated. If so, request they paste each image into chat for descriptive alt-text generation.

### Info Dumping

Once initial questions are answered, encourage the user to dump all the context they have. Request information such as:
- Background on the project/problem
- Related team discussions or shared documents
- Why alternative solutions aren't being used
- Organizational context (team dynamics, past incidents, politics)
- Timeline pressures or constraints
- Technical architecture or dependencies
- Stakeholder concerns

Advise them not to worry about organizing it - just get it all out. Offer multiple ways to provide context:
- Info dump stream-of-consciousness
- Point to team channels or threads to read
- Link to shared documents

**If integrations are available** (e.g., Slack, Teams, Google Drive, SharePoint, or other MCP servers), mention that these can be used to pull in context directly.

**If no integrations are detected and in Claude.ai or Claude app:** Suggest they can enable connectors in their Claude settings to allow pulling context from messaging apps and document storage directly.

Inform them clarifying questions will be asked once they've done their initial dump.

**During context gathering:**

- If user mentions team channels or shared documents:
  - If integrations available: Inform them the content will be read now, then use the appropriate integration
  - If integrations not available: Explain lack of access. Suggest they enable connectors in Claude settings, or paste the relevant content directly.

- If user mentions entities/projects that are unknown:
  - Ask if connected tools should be searched to learn more
  - Wait for user confirmation before searching

- As user provides context, track what's being learned and what's still unclear

**Asking clarifying questions:**

When user signals they've done their initial dump (or after substantial context provided), ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding:

Generate 5-10 numbered questions based on gaps in the context.

Inform them they can use shorthand to answer (e.g., "1: yes, 2: see #channel, 3: no because backwards compat"), link to more docs, point to channels to read, or just keep info-dumping. Whatever's most efficient for them.

**Exit condition:**
Sufficient context has been gathered when questions show understanding - when edge cases and trade-offs can be asked about without needing basics explained.

**Transition:**
Ask if there's any more context they want to provide at this stage, or if it's time to move on to drafting the document.

If user wants to add more, let them. When ready, proceed to Stage 2.

## Stage 2: Refinement & Structure

**Goal:** Build the document section by section through brainstorming, curation, and iterative refinement.

**Instructions to user:**
Explain that the document will be built section by section. For each section:
1. Clarifying questions will be asked about what to include
2. 5-20 options will be brainstormed
3. User will indicate what to keep/remove/combine
4. The section will be drafted
5. It will be refined through surgical edits

Start with whichever section has the most unknowns (usually the core decision/proposal), then work through the rest.

**Section ordering:**

If the document structure is clear:
Ask which section they'd like to start with.

Suggest starting with whichever section has the most unknowns. For decision docs, that's usually the core proposal. For specs, it's typically the technical approach. Summary sections are best left for last.

If user doesn't know what sections they need:
Based on the type of document and template, suggest 3-5 sections appropriate for the doc type.

Ask if this structure works, or if they want to adjust it.

**Once structure is agreed:**

Create the initial document structure with placeholder text for all sections.

**If access to artifacts is available:**
Use \`create_file\` to create an artifact. This gives both Claude and the user a scaffold to work from.

Inform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created.

Create artifact with all section headers and brief placeholder text like "[To be written]" or "[Content here]".

Provide the scaffold link and indicate it's time to fill in each section.

**If no access to artifacts:**
Create a markdown file in the working directory. Name it appropriately (e.g., \`decision-doc.md\`, \`technical-spec.md\`).

Inform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created.

Create file with all section headers and placeholder text.

Confirm the filename has been created and indicate it's time to fill in each section.

**For each section:**

### Step 1: Clarifying Questions

Announce work will begin on the [SECTION NAME] section. Ask 5-10 clarifying questions about what should be included:

Generate 5-10 specific questions based on context and section purpose.

Inform them they can answer in shorthand or just indicate what's important to cover.

### Step 2: Brainstorming

For the [SECTION NAME] section, brainstorm [5-20] things that might be included, depending on the section's complexity. Look for:
- Context shared that might have been forgotten
- Angles or considerations not yet mentioned

Generate 5-20 numbered options based on section complexity. At the end, offer to brainstorm more if they want additional options.

### Step 3: Curation

Ask which points should be kept, removed, or combined. Request brief justifications to help learn priorities for the next sections.

Provide examples:
- "Keep 1,4,7,9"
- "Remove 3 (duplicates 1)"
- "Remove 6 (audience already knows this)"
- "Combine 11 and 12"

**If user gives freeform feedback** (e.g., "looks good" or "I like most of it but...") instead of numbered selections, extract their preferences and proceed. Parse what they want kept/removed/changed and apply it.

### Step 4: Gap Check

Based on what they've selected, ask if there's anything important missing for the [SECTION NAME] section.

### Step 5: Drafting

Use \`str_replace\` to replace the placeholder text for this section with the actual drafted content.

Announce the [SECTION NAME] section will be drafted now based on what they've selected.

**If using artifacts:**
After drafting, provide a link to the artifact.

Ask them to read through it and indicate what to change. Note that being specific helps learning for the next sections.

**If using a file (no artifacts):**
After drafting, confirm completion.

Inform them the [SECTION NAME] section has been drafted in [filename]. Ask them to read through it and indicate what to change. Note that being specific helps learning for the next sections.

**Key instruction for user (include when drafting the first section):**
Provide a note: Instead of editing the doc directly, ask them to indicate what to change. This helps learning of their style for future sections. For example: "Remove the X bullet - already covered by Y" or "Make the third paragraph more concise".

### Step 6: Iterative Refinement

As user provides feedback:
- Use \`str_replace\` to make edits (never reprint the whole doc)
- **If using artifacts:** Provide link to artifact after each edit
- **If using files:** Just confirm edits are complete
- If user edits doc directly and asks to read it: mentally note the changes they made and keep them in mind for future sections (this shows their preferences)

**Continue iterating** until user is satisfied with the section.

### Quality Checking

After 3 consecutive iterations with no substantial changes, ask if anything can be removed without losing important information.

When section is done, confirm [SECTION NAME] is complete. Ask if ready to move to the next section.

**Repeat for all sections.**

### Near Completion

As approaching completion (80%+ of sections done), announce intention to re-read the entire document and check for:
- Flow and consistency across sections
- Redundancy or contradictions
- Anything that feels like "slop" or generic filler
- Whether every sentence carries weight

Read entire document and provide feedback.

**When all sections are drafted and refined:**
Announce all sections are drafted. Indicate intention to review the complete document one more time.

Review for overall coherence, flow, completeness.

Provide any final suggestions.

Ask if ready to move to Reader Testing, or if they want to refine anything else.

## Stage 3: Reader Testing

**Goal:** Test the document with a fresh Claude (no context bleed) to verify it works for readers.

**Instructions to user:**
Explain that testing will now occur to see if the document actually works for readers. This catches blind spots - things that make sense to the authors but might confuse others.

### Testing Approach

**If access to sub-agents is available (e.g., in Claude Code):**

Perform the testing directly without user involvement.

### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions

Announce intention to predict what questions readers might ask when trying to discover this document.

Generate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask.

### Step 2: Test with Sub-Agent

Announce that these questions will be tested with a fresh Claude instance (no context from this conversation).

For each question, invoke a sub-agent with just the document content and the question.

Summarize what Reader Claude got right/wrong for each question.

### Step 3: Run Additional Checks

Announce additional checks will be performed.

Invoke sub-agent to check for ambiguity, false assumptions, contradictions.

Summarize any issues found.

### Step 4: Report and Fix

If issues found:
Report that Reader Claude struggled with specific issues.

List the specific issues.

Indicate intention to fix these gaps.

Loop back to refinement for problematic sections.

---

**If no access to sub-agents (e.g., claude.ai web interface):**

The user will need to do the testing manually.

### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions

Ask what questions people might ask when trying to discover this document. What would they type into Claude.ai?

Generate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask.

### Step 2: Setup Testing

Provide testing instructions:
1. Open a fresh Claude conversation: https://claude.ai
2. Paste or share the document content (if using a shared doc platform with connectors enabled, provide the link)
3. Ask Reader Claude the generated questions

For each question, instruct Reader Claude to provide:
- The answer
- Whether anything was ambiguous or unclear
- What knowledge/context the doc assumes is already known

Check if Reader Claude gives correct answers or misinterprets anything.

### Step 3: Additional Checks

Also ask Reader Claude:
- "What in this doc might be ambiguous or unclear to readers?"
- "What knowledge or context does this doc assume readers already have?"
- "Are there any internal contradictions or inconsistencies?"

### Step 4: Iterate Based on Results

Ask what Reader Claude got wrong or struggled with. Indicate intention to fix those gaps.

Loop back to refinement for any problematic sections.

---

### Exit Condition (Both Approaches)

When Reader Claude consistently answers questions correctly and doesn't surface new gaps or ambiguities, the doc is ready.

## Final Review

When Reader Testing passes:
Announce the doc has passed Reader Claude testing. Before completion:

1. Recommend they do a final read-through themselves - they own this document and are responsible for its quality
2. Suggest double-checking any facts, links, or technical details
3. Ask them to verify it achieves the impact they wanted

Ask if they want one more review, or if the work is done.

**If user wants final review, provide it. Otherwise:**
Announce document completion. Provide a few final tips:
- Consider linking this conversation in an appendix so readers can see how the doc was developed
- Use appendices to provide depth without bloating the main doc
- Update the doc as feedback is received from real readers

## Tips for Effective Guidance

**Tone:**
- Be direct and procedural
- Explain rationale briefly when it affects user behavior
- Don't try to "sell" the approach - just execute it

**Handling Deviations:**
- If user wants to skip a stage: Ask if they want to skip this and write freeform
- If user seems frustrated: Acknowledge this is taking longer than expected. Suggest ways to move faster
- Always give user agency to adjust the process

**Context Management:**
- Throughout, if context is missing on something mentioned, proactively ask
- Don't let gaps accumulate - address them as they come up

**Artifact Management:**
- Use \`create_file\` for drafting full sections
- Use \`str_replace\` for all edits
- Provide artifact link after every change
- Never use artifacts for brainstorming lists - that's just conversation

**Quality over Speed:**
- Don't rush through stages
- Each iteration should make meaningful improvements
- The goal is a document that actually works for readers`,

# DOCX creation, editing, and analysis

## Overview

A .docx file is a ZIP archive containing XML files.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Read/analyze content | \`pandoc\` or unpack for raw XML |
| Create new document | Use \`docx-js\` - see Creating New Documents below |
| Edit existing document | Unpack → edit XML → repack - see Editing Existing Documents below |

### Converting .doc to .docx

Legacy \`.doc\` files must be converted before editing:

\`\`\`bash
python scripts/office/soffice.py --headless --convert-to docx document.doc
\`\`\`

### Reading Content

\`\`\`bash
# Text extraction with tracked changes
pandoc --track-changes=all document.docx -o output.md

# Raw XML access
python scripts/office/unpack.py document.docx unpacked/
\`\`\`

### Converting to Images

\`\`\`bash
python scripts/office/soffice.py --headless --convert-to pdf document.docx
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 document.pdf page
\`\`\`

### Accepting Tracked Changes

To produce a clean document with all tracked changes accepted (requires LibreOffice):

\`\`\`bash
python scripts/accept_changes.py input.docx output.docx
\`\`\`

---

## Creating New Documents

Generate .docx files with JavaScript, then validate. Install: \`npm install -g docx\`

### Setup
\`\`\`javascript
const { Document, Packer, Paragraph, TextRun, Table, TableRow, TableCell, ImageRun,
        Header, Footer, AlignmentType, PageOrientation, LevelFormat, ExternalHyperlink,
        InternalHyperlink, Bookmark, FootnoteReferenceRun, PositionalTab,
        PositionalTabAlignment, PositionalTabRelativeTo, PositionalTabLeader,
        TabStopType, TabStopPosition, Column, SectionType,
        TableOfContents, HeadingLevel, BorderStyle, WidthType, ShadingType,
        VerticalAlign, PageNumber, PageBreak } = require('docx');

const doc = new Document({ sections: [{ children: [/* content */] }] });
Packer.toBuffer(doc).then(buffer => fs.writeFileSync("doc.docx", buffer));
\`\`\`

### Validation
After creating the file, validate it. If validation fails, unpack, fix the XML, and repack.
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/office/validate.py doc.docx
\`\`\`

### Page Size

\`\`\`javascript
// CRITICAL: docx-js defaults to A4, not US Letter
// Always set page size explicitly for consistent results
sections: [{
  properties: {
    page: {
      size: {
        width: 12240,   // 8.5 inches in DXA
        height: 15840   // 11 inches in DXA
      },
      margin: { top: 1440, right: 1440, bottom: 1440, left: 1440 } // 1 inch margins
    }
  },
  children: [/* content */]
}]
\`\`\`

**Common page sizes (DXA units, 1440 DXA = 1 inch):**

| Paper | Width | Height | Content Width (1" margins) |
|-------|-------|--------|---------------------------|
| US Letter | 12,240 | 15,840 | 9,360 |
| A4 (default) | 11,906 | 16,838 | 9,026 |

**Landscape orientation:** docx-js swaps width/height internally, so pass portrait dimensions and let it handle the swap:
\`\`\`javascript
size: {
  width: 12240,   // Pass SHORT edge as width
  height: 15840,  // Pass LONG edge as height
  orientation: PageOrientation.LANDSCAPE  // docx-js swaps them in the XML
},
// Content width = 15840 - left margin - right margin (uses the long edge)
\`\`\`

### Styles (Override Built-in Headings)

Use Arial as the default font (universally supported). Keep titles black for readability.

\`\`\`javascript
const doc = new Document({
  styles: {
    default: { document: { run: { font: "Arial", size: 24 } } }, // 12pt default
    paragraphStyles: [
      // IMPORTANT: Use exact IDs to override built-in styles
      { id: "Heading1", name: "Heading 1", basedOn: "Normal", next: "Normal", quickFormat: true,
        run: { size: 32, bold: true, font: "Arial" },
        paragraph: { spacing: { before: 240, after: 240 }, outlineLevel: 0 } }, // outlineLevel required for TOC
      { id: "Heading2", name: "Heading 2", basedOn: "Normal", next: "Normal", quickFormat: true,
        run: { size: 28, bold: true, font: "Arial" },
        paragraph: { spacing: { before: 180, after: 180 }, outlineLevel: 1 } },
    ]
  },
  sections: [{
    children: [
      new Paragraph({ heading: HeadingLevel.HEADING_1, children: [new TextRun("Title")] }),
    ]
  }]
});
\`\`\`

### Lists (NEVER use unicode bullets)

\`\`\`javascript
// ❌ WRONG - never manually insert bullet characters
new Paragraph({ children: [new TextRun("• Item")] })  // BAD
new Paragraph({ children: [new TextRun("\\u2022 Item")] })  // BAD

// ✅ CORRECT - use numbering config with LevelFormat.BULLET
const doc = new Document({
  numbering: {
    config: [
      { reference: "bullets",
        levels: [{ level: 0, format: LevelFormat.BULLET, text: "•", alignment: AlignmentType.LEFT,
          style: { paragraph: { indent: { left: 720, hanging: 360 } } } }] },
      { reference: "numbers",
        levels: [{ level: 0, format: LevelFormat.DECIMAL, text: "%1.", alignment: AlignmentType.LEFT,
          style: { paragraph: { indent: { left: 720, hanging: 360 } } } }] },
    ]
  },
  sections: [{
    children: [
      new Paragraph({ numbering: { reference: "bullets", level: 0 },
        children: [new TextRun("Bullet item")] }),
      new Paragraph({ numbering: { reference: "numbers", level: 0 },
        children: [new TextRun("Numbered item")] }),
    ]
  }]
});

// ⚠️ Each reference creates INDEPENDENT numbering
// Same reference = continues (1,2,3 then 4,5,6)
// Different reference = restarts (1,2,3 then 1,2,3)
\`\`\`

### Tables

**CRITICAL: Tables need dual widths** - set both \`columnWidths\` on the table AND \`width\` on each cell. Without both, tables render incorrectly on some platforms.

\`\`\`javascript
// CRITICAL: Always set table width for consistent rendering
// CRITICAL: Use ShadingType.CLEAR (not SOLID) to prevent black backgrounds
const border = { style: BorderStyle.SINGLE, size: 1, color: "CCCCCC" };
const borders = { top: border, bottom: border, left: border, right: border };

new Table({
  width: { size: 9360, type: WidthType.DXA }, // Always use DXA (percentages break in Google Docs)
  columnWidths: [4680, 4680], // Must sum to table width (DXA: 1440 = 1 inch)
  rows: [
    new TableRow({
      children: [
        new TableCell({
          borders,
          width: { size: 4680, type: WidthType.DXA }, // Also set on each cell
          shading: { fill: "D5E8F0", type: ShadingType.CLEAR }, // CLEAR not SOLID
          margins: { top: 80, bottom: 80, left: 120, right: 120 }, // Cell padding (internal, not added to width)
          children: [new Paragraph({ children: [new TextRun("Cell")] })]
        })
      ]
    })
  ]
})
\`\`\`

**Table width calculation:**

Always use \`WidthType.DXA\` — \`WidthType.PERCENTAGE\` breaks in Google Docs.

\`\`\`javascript
// Table width = sum of columnWidths = content width
// US Letter with 1" margins: 12240 - 2880 = 9360 DXA
width: { size: 9360, type: WidthType.DXA },
columnWidths: [7000, 2360]  // Must sum to table width
\`\`\`

**Width rules:**
- **Always use \`WidthType.DXA\`** — never \`WidthType.PERCENTAGE\` (incompatible with Google Docs)
- Table width must equal the sum of \`columnWidths\`
- Cell \`width\` must match corresponding \`columnWidth\`
- Cell \`margins\` are internal padding - they reduce content area, not add to cell width
- For full-width tables: use content width (page width minus left and right margins)

### Images

\`\`\`javascript
// CRITICAL: type parameter is REQUIRED
new Paragraph({
  children: [new ImageRun({
    type: "png", // Required: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, svg
    data: fs.readFileSync("image.png"),
    transformation: { width: 200, height: 150 },
    altText: { title: "Title", description: "Desc", name: "Name" } // All three required
  })]
})
\`\`\`

### Page Breaks

\`\`\`javascript
// CRITICAL: PageBreak must be inside a Paragraph
new Paragraph({ children: [new PageBreak()] })

// Or use pageBreakBefore
new Paragraph({ pageBreakBefore: true, children: [new TextRun("New page")] })
\`\`\`

### Hyperlinks

\`\`\`javascript
// External link
new Paragraph({
  children: [new ExternalHyperlink({
    children: [new TextRun({ text: "Click here", style: "Hyperlink" })],
    link: "https://example.com",
  })]
})

// Internal link (bookmark + reference)
// 1. Create bookmark at destination
new Paragraph({ heading: HeadingLevel.HEADING_1, children: [
  new Bookmark({ id: "chapter1", children: [new TextRun("Chapter 1")] }),
]})
// 2. Link to it
new Paragraph({ children: [new InternalHyperlink({
  children: [new TextRun({ text: "See Chapter 1", style: "Hyperlink" })],
  anchor: "chapter1",
})]})
\`\`\`

### Footnotes

\`\`\`javascript
const doc = new Document({
  footnotes: {
    1: { children: [new Paragraph("Source: Annual Report 2024")] },
    2: { children: [new Paragraph("See appendix for methodology")] },
  },
  sections: [{
    children: [new Paragraph({
      children: [
        new TextRun("Revenue grew 15%"),
        new FootnoteReferenceRun(1),
        new TextRun(" using adjusted metrics"),
        new FootnoteReferenceRun(2),
      ],
    })]
  }]
});
\`\`\`

### Tab Stops

\`\`\`javascript
// Right-align text on same line (e.g., date opposite a title)
new Paragraph({
  children: [
    new TextRun("Company Name"),
    new TextRun("\\tJanuary 2025"),
  ],
  tabStops: [{ type: TabStopType.RIGHT, position: TabStopPosition.MAX }],
})

// Dot leader (e.g., TOC-style)
new Paragraph({
  children: [
    new TextRun("Introduction"),
    new TextRun({ children: [
      new PositionalTab({
        alignment: PositionalTabAlignment.RIGHT,
        relativeTo: PositionalTabRelativeTo.MARGIN,
        leader: PositionalTabLeader.DOT,
      }),
      "3",
    ]}),
  ],
})
\`\`\`

### Multi-Column Layouts

\`\`\`javascript
// Equal-width columns
sections: [{
  properties: {
    column: {
      count: 2,          // number of columns
      space: 720,        // gap between columns in DXA (720 = 0.5 inch)
      equalWidth: true,
      separate: true,    // vertical line between columns
    },
  },
  children: [/* content flows naturally across columns */]
}]

// Custom-width columns (equalWidth must be false)
sections: [{
  properties: {
    column: {
      equalWidth: false,
      children: [
        new Column({ width: 5400, space: 720 }),
        new Column({ width: 3240 }),
      ],
    },
  },
  children: [/* content */]
}]
\`\`\`

Force a column break with a new section using \`type: SectionType.NEXT_COLUMN\`.

### Table of Contents

\`\`\`javascript
// CRITICAL: Headings must use HeadingLevel ONLY - no custom styles
new TableOfContents("Table of Contents", { hyperlink: true, headingStyleRange: "1-3" })
\`\`\`

### Headers/Footers

\`\`\`javascript
sections: [{
  properties: {
    page: { margin: { top: 1440, right: 1440, bottom: 1440, left: 1440 } } // 1440 = 1 inch
  },
  headers: {
    default: new Header({ children: [new Paragraph({ children: [new TextRun("Header")] })] })
  },
  footers: {
    default: new Footer({ children: [new Paragraph({
      children: [new TextRun("Page "), new TextRun({ children: [PageNumber.CURRENT] })]
    })] })
  },
  children: [/* content */]
}]
\`\`\`

### Critical Rules for docx-js

- **Set page size explicitly** - docx-js defaults to A4; use US Letter (12240 x 15840 DXA) for US documents
- **Landscape: pass portrait dimensions** - docx-js swaps width/height internally; pass short edge as \`width\`, long edge as \`height\`, and set \`orientation: PageOrientation.LANDSCAPE\`
- **Never use \`\\n\`** - use separate Paragraph elements
- **Never use unicode bullets** - use \`LevelFormat.BULLET\` with numbering config
- **PageBreak must be in Paragraph** - standalone creates invalid XML
- **ImageRun requires \`type\`** - always specify png/jpg/etc
- **Always set table \`width\` with DXA** - never use \`WidthType.PERCENTAGE\` (breaks in Google Docs)
- **Tables need dual widths** - \`columnWidths\` array AND cell \`width\`, both must match
- **Table width = sum of columnWidths** - for DXA, ensure they add up exactly
- **Always add cell margins** - use \`margins: { top: 80, bottom: 80, left: 120, right: 120 }\` for readable padding
- **Use \`ShadingType.CLEAR\`** - never SOLID for table shading
- **Never use tables as dividers/rules** - cells have minimum height and render as empty boxes (including in headers/footers); use \`border: { bottom: { style: BorderStyle.SINGLE, size: 6, color: "2E75B6", space: 1 } }\` on a Paragraph instead. For two-column footers, use tab stops (see Tab Stops section), not tables
- **TOC requires HeadingLevel only** - no custom styles on heading paragraphs
- **Override built-in styles** - use exact IDs: "Heading1", "Heading2", etc.
- **Include \`outlineLevel\`** - required for TOC (0 for H1, 1 for H2, etc.)

---

## Editing Existing Documents

**Follow all 3 steps in order.**

### Step 1: Unpack
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/office/unpack.py document.docx unpacked/
\`\`\`
Extracts XML, pretty-prints, merges adjacent runs, and converts smart quotes to XML entities (\`&#x201C;\` etc.) so they survive editing. Use \`--merge-runs false\` to skip run merging.

### Step 2: Edit XML

Edit files in \`unpacked/word/\`. See XML Reference below for patterns.

**Use "Claude" as the author** for tracked changes and comments, unless the user explicitly requests use of a different name.

**Use the Edit tool directly for string replacement. Do not write Python scripts.** Scripts introduce unnecessary complexity. The Edit tool shows exactly what is being replaced.

**CRITICAL: Use smart quotes for new content.** When adding text with apostrophes or quotes, use XML entities to produce smart quotes:
\`\`\`xml
<!-- Use these entities for professional typography -->
<w:t>Here&#x2019;s a quote: &#x201C;Hello&#x201D;</w:t>
\`\`\`
| Entity | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| \`&#x2018;\` | ‘ (left single) |
| \`&#x2019;\` | ’ (right single / apostrophe) |
| \`&#x201C;\` | “ (left double) |
| \`&#x201D;\` | ” (right double) |

**Adding comments:** Use \`comment.py\` to handle boilerplate across multiple XML files (text must be pre-escaped XML):
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/comment.py unpacked/ 0 "Comment text with &amp; and &#x2019;"
python scripts/comment.py unpacked/ 1 "Reply text" --parent 0  # reply to comment 0
python scripts/comment.py unpacked/ 0 "Text" --author "Custom Author"  # custom author name
\`\`\`
Then add markers to document.xml (see Comments in XML Reference).

### Step 3: Pack
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/office/pack.py unpacked/ output.docx --original document.docx
\`\`\`
Validates with auto-repair, condenses XML, and creates DOCX. Use \`--validate false\` to skip.

**Auto-repair will fix:**
- \`durableId\` >= 0x7FFFFFFF (regenerates valid ID)
- Missing \`xml:space="preserve"\` on \`<w:t>\` with whitespace

**Auto-repair won't fix:**
- Malformed XML, invalid element nesting, missing relationships, schema violations

### Common Pitfalls

- **Replace entire \`<w:r>\` elements**: When adding tracked changes, replace the whole \`<w:r>...</w:r>\` block with \`<w:del>...<w:ins>...\` as siblings. Don't inject tracked change tags inside a run.
- **Preserve \`<w:rPr>\` formatting**: Copy the original run's \`<w:rPr>\` block into your tracked change runs to maintain bold, font size, etc.

---

## XML Reference

### Schema Compliance

- **Element order in \`<w:pPr>\`**: \`<w:pStyle>\`, \`<w:numPr>\`, \`<w:spacing>\`, \`<w:ind>\`, \`<w:jc>\`, \`<w:rPr>\` last
- **Whitespace**: Add \`xml:space="preserve"\` to \`<w:t>\` with leading/trailing spaces
- **RSIDs**: Must be 8-digit hex (e.g., \`00AB1234\`)

### Tracked Changes

**Insertion:**
\`\`\`xml
<w:ins w:id="1" w:author="Claude" w:date="2025-01-01T00:00:00Z">
  <w:r><w:t>inserted text</w:t></w:r>
</w:ins>
\`\`\`

**Deletion:**
\`\`\`xml
<w:del w:id="2" w:author="Claude" w:date="2025-01-01T00:00:00Z">
  <w:r><w:delText>deleted text</w:delText></w:r>
</w:del>
\`\`\`

**Inside \`<w:del>\`**: Use \`<w:delText>\` instead of \`<w:t>\`, and \`<w:delInstrText>\` instead of \`<w:instrText>\`.

**Minimal edits** - only mark what changes:
\`\`\`xml
<!-- Change "30 days" to "60 days" -->
<w:r><w:t>The term is </w:t></w:r>
<w:del w:id="1" w:author="Claude" w:date="...">
  <w:r><w:delText>30</w:delText></w:r>
</w:del>
<w:ins w:id="2" w:author="Claude" w:date="...">
  <w:r><w:t>60</w:t></w:r>
</w:ins>
<w:r><w:t> days.</w:t></w:r>
\`\`\`

**Deleting entire paragraphs/list items** - when removing ALL content from a paragraph, also mark the paragraph mark as deleted so it merges with the next paragraph. Add \`<w:del/>\` inside \`<w:pPr><w:rPr>\`:
\`\`\`xml
<w:p>
  <w:pPr>
    <w:numPr>...</w:numPr>  <!-- list numbering if present -->
    <w:rPr>
      <w:del w:id="1" w:author="Claude" w:date="2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"/>
    </w:rPr>
  </w:pPr>
  <w:del w:id="2" w:author="Claude" w:date="2025-01-01T00:00:00Z">
    <w:r><w:delText>Entire paragraph content being deleted...</w:delText></w:r>
  </w:del>
</w:p>
\`\`\`
Without the \`<w:del/>\` in \`<w:pPr><w:rPr>\`, accepting changes leaves an empty paragraph/list item.

**Rejecting another author's insertion** - nest deletion inside their insertion:
\`\`\`xml
<w:ins w:author="Jane" w:id="5">
  <w:del w:author="Claude" w:id="10">
    <w:r><w:delText>their inserted text</w:delText></w:r>
  </w:del>
</w:ins>
\`\`\`

**Restoring another author's deletion** - add insertion after (don't modify their deletion):
\`\`\`xml
<w:del w:author="Jane" w:id="5">
  <w:r><w:delText>deleted text</w:delText></w:r>
</w:del>
<w:ins w:author="Claude" w:id="10">
  <w:r><w:t>deleted text</w:t></w:r>
</w:ins>
\`\`\`

### Comments

After running \`comment.py\` (see Step 2), add markers to document.xml. For replies, use \`--parent\` flag and nest markers inside the parent's.

**CRITICAL: \`<w:commentRangeStart>\` and \`<w:commentRangeEnd>\` are siblings of \`<w:r>\`, never inside \`<w:r>\`.**

\`\`\`xml
<!-- Comment markers are direct children of w:p, never inside w:r -->
<w:commentRangeStart w:id="0"/>
<w:del w:id="1" w:author="Claude" w:date="2025-01-01T00:00:00Z">
  <w:r><w:delText>deleted</w:delText></w:r>
</w:del>
<w:r><w:t> more text</w:t></w:r>
<w:commentRangeEnd w:id="0"/>
<w:r><w:rPr><w:rStyle w:val="CommentReference"/></w:rPr><w:commentReference w:id="0"/></w:r>

<!-- Comment 0 with reply 1 nested inside -->
<w:commentRangeStart w:id="0"/>
  <w:commentRangeStart w:id="1"/>
  <w:r><w:t>text</w:t></w:r>
  <w:commentRangeEnd w:id="1"/>
<w:commentRangeEnd w:id="0"/>
<w:r><w:rPr><w:rStyle w:val="CommentReference"/></w:rPr><w:commentReference w:id="0"/></w:r>
<w:r><w:rPr><w:rStyle w:val="CommentReference"/></w:rPr><w:commentReference w:id="1"/></w:r>
\`\`\`

### Images

1. Add image file to \`word/media/\`
2. Add relationship to \`word/_rels/document.xml.rels\`:
\`\`\`xml
<Relationship Id="rId5" Type=".../image" Target="media/image1.png"/>
\`\`\`
3. Add content type to \`[Content_Types].xml\`:
\`\`\`xml
<Default Extension="png" ContentType="image/png"/>
\`\`\`
4. Reference in document.xml:
\`\`\`xml
<w:drawing>
  <wp:inline>
    <wp:extent cx="914400" cy="914400"/>  <!-- EMUs: 914400 = 1 inch -->
    <a:graphic>
      <a:graphicData uri=".../picture">
        <pic:pic>
          <pic:blipFill><a:blip r:embed="rId5"/></pic:blipFill>
        </pic:pic>
      </a:graphicData>
    </a:graphic>
  </wp:inline>
</w:drawing>

# PDF Processing Guide

## Overview

This guide covers essential PDF processing operations using Python libraries and command-line tools. For advanced features, JavaScript libraries, and detailed examples, see REFERENCE.md. If you need to fill out a PDF form, read FORMS.md and follow its instructions.

## Quick Start

\`\`\`python
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter

# Read a PDF
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
print(f"Pages: {len(reader.pages)}")

# Extract text
text = ""
for page in reader.pages:
    text += page.extract_text()
\`\`\`

## Python Libraries

### pypdf - Basic Operations

#### Merge PDFs
\`\`\`python
from pypdf import PdfWriter, PdfReader

writer = PdfWriter()
for pdf_file in ["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf", "doc3.pdf"]:
    reader = PdfReader(pdf_file)
    for page in reader.pages:
        writer.add_page(page)

with open("merged.pdf", "wb") as output:
    writer.write(output)
\`\`\`

#### Split PDF
\`\`\`python
reader = PdfReader("input.pdf")
for i, page in enumerate(reader.pages):
    writer = PdfWriter()
    writer.add_page(page)
    with open(f"page_{i+1}.pdf", "wb") as output:
        writer.write(output)
\`\`\`

#### Extract Metadata
\`\`\`python
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
meta = reader.metadata
print(f"Title: {meta.title}")
print(f"Author: {meta.author}")
print(f"Subject: {meta.subject}")
print(f"Creator: {meta.creator}")
\`\`\`

#### Rotate Pages
\`\`\`python
reader = PdfReader("input.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()

page = reader.pages[0]
page.rotate(90)  # Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
writer.add_page(page)

with open("rotated.pdf", "wb") as output:
    writer.write(output)
\`\`\`

### pdfplumber - Text and Table Extraction

#### Extract Text with Layout
\`\`\`python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    for page in pdf.pages:
        text = page.extract_text()
        print(text)
\`\`\`

#### Extract Tables
\`\`\`python
with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    for i, page in enumerate(pdf.pages):
        tables = page.extract_tables()
        for j, table in enumerate(tables):
            print(f"Table {j+1} on page {i+1}:")
            for row in table:
                print(row)
\`\`\`

#### Advanced Table Extraction
\`\`\`python
import pandas as pd

with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    all_tables = []
    for page in pdf.pages:
        tables = page.extract_tables()
        for table in tables:
            if table:  # Check if table is not empty
                df = pd.DataFrame(table[1:], columns=table[0])
                all_tables.append(df)

# Combine all tables
if all_tables:
    combined_df = pd.concat(all_tables, ignore_index=True)
    combined_df.to_excel("extracted_tables.xlsx", index=False)
\`\`\`

### reportlab - Create PDFs

#### Basic PDF Creation
\`\`\`python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas

c = canvas.Canvas("hello.pdf", pagesize=letter)
width, height = letter

# Add text
c.drawString(100, height - 100, "Hello World!")
c.drawString(100, height - 120, "This is a PDF created with reportlab")

# Add a line
c.line(100, height - 140, 400, height - 140)

# Save
c.save()
\`\`\`

#### Create PDF with Multiple Pages
\`\`\`python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, Spacer, PageBreak
from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet

doc = SimpleDocTemplate("report.pdf", pagesize=letter)
styles = getSampleStyleSheet()
story = []

# Add content
title = Paragraph("Report Title", styles['Title'])
story.append(title)
story.append(Spacer(1, 12))

body = Paragraph("This is the body of the report. " * 20, styles['Normal'])
story.append(body)
story.append(PageBreak())

# Page 2
story.append(Paragraph("Page 2", styles['Heading1']))
story.append(Paragraph("Content for page 2", styles['Normal']))

# Build PDF
doc.build(story)
\`\`\`

#### Subscripts and Superscripts

**IMPORTANT**: Never use Unicode subscript/superscript characters (₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉, ⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹) in ReportLab PDFs. The built-in fonts do not include these glyphs, causing them to render as solid black boxes.

Instead, use ReportLab's XML markup tags in Paragraph objects:
\`\`\`python
from reportlab.platypus import Paragraph
from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet

styles = getSampleStyleSheet()

# Subscripts: use <sub> tag
chemical = Paragraph("H<sub>2</sub>O", styles['Normal'])

# Superscripts: use <super> tag
squared = Paragraph("x<super>2</super> + y<super>2</super>", styles['Normal'])
\`\`\`

For canvas-drawn text (not Paragraph objects), manually adjust font the size and position rather than using Unicode subscripts/superscripts.

## Command-Line Tools

### pdftotext (poppler-utils)
\`\`\`bash
# Extract text
pdftotext input.pdf output.txt

# Extract text preserving layout
pdftotext -layout input.pdf output.txt

# Extract specific pages
pdftotext -f 1 -l 5 input.pdf output.txt  # Pages 1-5
\`\`\`

### qpdf
\`\`\`bash
# Merge PDFs
qpdf --empty --pages file1.pdf file2.pdf -- merged.pdf

# Split pages
qpdf input.pdf --pages . 1-5 -- pages1-5.pdf
qpdf input.pdf --pages . 6-10 -- pages6-10.pdf

# Rotate pages
qpdf input.pdf output.pdf --rotate=+90:1  # Rotate page 1 by 90 degrees

# Remove password
qpdf --password=mypassword --decrypt encrypted.pdf decrypted.pdf
\`\`\`

### pdftk (if available)
\`\`\`bash
# Merge
pdftk file1.pdf file2.pdf cat output merged.pdf

# Split
pdftk input.pdf burst

# Rotate
pdftk input.pdf rotate 1east output rotated.pdf
\`\`\`

## Common Tasks

### Extract Text from Scanned PDFs
\`\`\`python
# Requires: pip install pytesseract pdf2image
import pytesseract
from pdf2image import convert_from_path

# Convert PDF to images
images = convert_from_path('scanned.pdf')

# OCR each page
text = ""
for i, image in enumerate(images):
    text += f"Page {i+1}:\\n"
    text += pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
    text += "\\n\\n"

print(text)
\`\`\`

### Add Watermark
\`\`\`python
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter

# Create watermark (or load existing)
watermark = PdfReader("watermark.pdf").pages[0]

# Apply to all pages
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()

for page in reader.pages:
    page.merge_page(watermark)
    writer.add_page(page)

with open("watermarked.pdf", "wb") as output:
    writer.write(output)
\`\`\`

### Extract Images
\`\`\`bash

## Design Ideas

**Don't create boring slides.** Plain bullets on a white background won't impress anyone. Consider ideas from this list for each slide.

### Before Starting

- **Pick a bold, content-informed color palette**: The palette should feel designed for THIS topic. If swapping your colors into a completely different presentation would still "work," you haven't made specific enough choices.
- **Dominance over equality**: One color should dominate (60-70% visual weight), with 1-2 supporting tones and one sharp accent. Never give all colors equal weight.
- **Dark/light contrast**: Dark backgrounds for title + conclusion slides, light for content ("sandwich" structure). Or commit to dark throughout for a premium feel.
- **Commit to a visual motif**: Pick ONE distinctive element and repeat it — rounded image frames, icons in colored circles, thick single-side borders. Carry it across every slide.

### Color Palettes

Choose colors that match your topic — don't default to generic blue. Use these palettes as inspiration:

| Theme | Primary | Secondary | Accent |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Midnight Executive** | \`1E2761\` (navy) | \`CADCFC\` (ice blue) | \`FFFFFF\` (white) |
| **Forest & Moss** | \`2C5F2D\` (forest) | \`97BC62\` (moss) | \`F5F5F5\` (cream) |
| **Coral Energy** | \`F96167\` (coral) | \`F9E795\` (gold) | \`2F3C7E\` (navy) |
| **Warm Terracotta** | \`B85042\` (terracotta) | \`E7E8D1\` (sand) | \`A7BEAE\` (sage) |
| **Ocean Gradient** | \`065A82\` (deep blue) | \`1C7293\` (teal) | \`21295C\` (midnight) |
| **Charcoal Minimal** | \`36454F\` (charcoal) | \`F2F2F2\` (off-white) | \`212121\` (black) |
| **Teal Trust** | \`028090\` (teal) | \`00A896\` (seafoam) | \`02C39A\` (mint) |
| **Berry & Cream** | \`6D2E46\` (berry) | \`A26769\` (dusty rose) | \`ECE2D0\` (cream) |
| **Sage Calm** | \`84B59F\` (sage) | \`69A297\` (eucalyptus) | \`50808E\` (slate) |
| **Cherry Bold** | \`990011\` (cherry) | \`FCF6F5\` (off-white) | \`2F3C7E\` (navy) |

### For Each Slide

**Every slide needs a visual element** — image, chart, icon, or shape. Text-only slides are forgettable.

**Layout options:**
- Two-column (text left, illustration on right)
- Icon + text rows (icon in colored circle, bold header, description below)
- 2x2 or 2x3 grid (image on one side, grid of content blocks on other)
- Half-bleed image (full left or right side) with content overlay

**Data display:**
- Large stat callouts (big numbers 60-72pt with small labels below)
- Comparison columns (before/after, pros/cons, side-by-side options)
- Timeline or process flow (numbered steps, arrows)

**Visual polish:**
- Icons in small colored circles next to section headers
- Italic accent text for key stats or taglines

### Typography

**Choose an interesting font pairing** — don't default to Arial. Pick a header font with personality and pair it with a clean body font.

| Header Font | Body Font |
|-------------|-----------|
| Georgia | Calibri |
| Arial Black | Arial |
| Calibri | Calibri Light |
| Cambria | Calibri |
| Trebuchet MS | Calibri |
| Impact | Arial |
| Palatino | Garamond |
| Consolas | Calibri |

| Element | Size |
|---------|------|
| Slide title | 36-44pt bold |
| Section header | 20-24pt bold |
| Body text | 14-16pt |
| Captions | 10-12pt muted |

### Spacing

- 0.5" minimum margins
- 0.3-0.5" between content blocks
- Leave breathing room—don't fill every inch

### Avoid (Common Mistakes)

- **Don't repeat the same layout** — vary columns, cards, and callouts across slides
- **Don't center body text** — left-align paragraphs and lists; center only titles
- **Don't skimp on size contrast** — titles need 36pt+ to stand out from 14-16pt body
- **Don't default to blue** — pick colors that reflect the specific topic
- **Don't mix spacing randomly** — choose 0.3" or 0.5" gaps and use consistently
- **Don't style one slide and leave the rest plain** — commit fully or keep it simple throughout
- **Don't create text-only slides** — add images, icons, charts, or visual elements; avoid plain title + bullets
- **Don't forget text box padding** — when aligning lines or shapes with text edges, set \`margin: 0\` on the text box or offset the shape to account for padding
- **Don't use low-contrast elements** — icons AND text need strong contrast against the background; avoid light text on light backgrounds or dark text on dark backgrounds
- **NEVER use accent lines under titles** — these are a hallmark of AI-generated slides; use whitespace or background color instead

---

## QA (Required)

**Assume there are problems. Your job is to find them.**

Your first render is almost never correct. Approach QA as a bug hunt, not a confirmation step. If you found zero issues on first inspection, you weren't looking hard enough.

### Content QA

\`\`\`bash
python -m markitdown output.pptx
\`\`\`

Check for missing content, typos, wrong order.

**When using templates, check for leftover placeholder text:**

\`\`\`bash
python -m markitdown output.pptx | grep -iE "xxxx|lorem|ipsum|this.*(page|slide).*layout"
\`\`\`

If grep returns results, fix them before declaring success.

### Visual QA

**⚠️ USE SUBAGENTS** — even for 2-3 slides. You've been staring at the code and will see what you expect, not what's there. Subagents have fresh eyes.

Convert slides to images (see [Converting to Images](#converting-to-images)), then use this prompt:

\`\`\`
Visually inspect these slides. Assume there are issues — find them.

Look for:
- Overlapping elements (text through shapes, lines through words, stacked elements)
- Text overflow or cut off at edges/box boundaries
- Decorative lines positioned for single-line text but title wrapped to two lines
- Source citations or footers colliding with content above
- Elements too close (< 0.3" gaps) or cards/sections nearly touching
- Uneven gaps (large empty area in one place, cramped in another)
- Insufficient margin from slide edges (< 0.5")
- Columns or similar elements not aligned consistently
- Low-contrast text (e.g., light gray text on cream-colored background)
- Low-contrast icons (e.g., dark icons on dark backgrounds without a contrasting circle)
- Text boxes too narrow causing excessive wrapping
- Leftover placeholder content

For each slide, list issues or areas of concern, even if minor.

Read and analyze these images:
1. /path/to/slide-01.jpg (Expected: [brief description])
2. /path/to/slide-02.jpg (Expected: [brief description])

Report ALL issues found, including minor ones.
\`\`\`

### Verification Loop

1. Generate slides → Convert to images → Inspect
2. **List issues found** (if none found, look again more critically)
3. Fix issues
4. **Re-verify affected slides** — one fix often creates another problem
5. Repeat until a full pass reveals no new issues

**Do not declare success until you've completed at least one fix-and-verify cycle.**

---

## Converting to Images

Convert presentations to individual slide images for visual inspection:

\`\`\`bash
python scripts/office/soffice.py --headless --convert-to pdf output.pptx
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 output.pdf slide
\`\`\`

This creates \`slide-01.jpg\`, \`slide-02.jpg\`, etc.

To re-render specific slides after fixes:

\`\`\`bash
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 -f N -l N output.pdf slide-fixed
\`\`\`

# Requirements for Outputs

## All Excel files

### Professional Font
- Use a consistent, professional font (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman) for all deliverables unless otherwise instructed by the user

### Zero Formula Errors
- Every Excel model MUST be delivered with ZERO formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #N/A, #NAME?)

### Preserve Existing Templates (when updating templates)
- Study and EXACTLY match existing format, style, and conventions when modifying files
- Never impose standardized formatting on files with established patterns
- Existing template conventions ALWAYS override these guidelines

## Financial models

### Color Coding Standards
Unless otherwise stated by the user or existing template

#### Industry-Standard Color Conventions
- **Blue text (RGB: 0,0,255)**: Hardcoded inputs, and numbers users will change for scenarios
- **Black text (RGB: 0,0,0)**: ALL formulas and calculations
- **Green text (RGB: 0,128,0)**: Links pulling from other worksheets within same workbook
- **Red text (RGB: 255,0,0)**: External links to other files
- **Yellow background (RGB: 255,255,0)**: Key assumptions needing attention or cells that need to be updated

### Number Formatting Standards

#### Required Format Rules
- **Years**: Format as text strings (e.g., "2024" not "2,024")
- **Currency**: Use $#,##0 format; ALWAYS specify units in headers ("Revenue ($mm)")
- **Zeros**: Use number formatting to make all zeros "-", including percentages (e.g., "$#,##0;($#,##0);-")
- **Percentages**: Default to 0.0% format (one decimal)
- **Multiples**: Format as 0.0x for valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA, P/E)
- **Negative numbers**: Use parentheses (123) not minus -123

### Formula Construction Rules

#### Assumptions Placement
- Place ALL assumptions (growth rates, margins, multiples, etc.) in separate assumption cells
- Use cell references instead of hardcoded values in formulas
- Example: Use =B5*(1+$B$6) instead of =B5*1.05

#### Formula Error Prevention
- Verify all cell references are correct
- Check for off-by-one errors in ranges
- Ensure consistent formulas across all projection periods
- Test with edge cases (zero values, negative numbers)
- Verify no unintended circular references

#### Documentation Requirements for Hardcodes
- Comment or in cells beside (if end of table). Format: "Source: [System/Document], [Date], [Specific Reference], [URL if applicable]"
- Examples:
  - "Source: Company 10-K, FY2024, Page 45, Revenue Note, [SEC EDGAR URL]"
  - "Source: Company 10-Q, Q2 2025, Exhibit 99.1, [SEC EDGAR URL]"
  - "Source: Bloomberg Terminal, 8/15/2025, AAPL US Equity"
  - "Source: FactSet, 8/20/2025, Consensus Estimates Screen"

# XLSX creation, editing, and analysis

## Overview

A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of an .xlsx file. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.

## Important Requirements

**LibreOffice Required for Formula Recalculation**: You can assume LibreOffice is installed for recalculating formula values using the \`scripts/recalc.py\` script. The script automatically configures LibreOffice on first run, including in sandboxed environments where Unix sockets are restricted (handled by \`scripts/office/soffice.py\`)

## Reading and analyzing data

### Data analysis with pandas
For data analysis, visualization, and basic operations, use **pandas** which provides powerful data manipulation capabilities:

\`\`\`python
import pandas as pd

# Read Excel
df = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx')  # Default: first sheet
all_sheets = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', sheet_name=None)  # All sheets as dict

# Analyze
df.head()      # Preview data
df.info()      # Column info
df.describe()  # Statistics

# Write Excel
df.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False)
\`\`\`

## Excel File Workflows

## CRITICAL: Use Formulas, Not Hardcoded Values

**Always use Excel formulas instead of calculating values in Python and hardcoding them.** This ensures the spreadsheet remains dynamic and updateable.

### ❌ WRONG - Hardcoding Calculated Values
\`\`\`python
# Bad: Calculating in Python and hardcoding result
total = df['Sales'].sum()
sheet['B10'] = total  # Hardcodes 5000

# Bad: Computing growth rate in Python
growth = (df.iloc[-1]['Revenue'] - df.iloc[0]['Revenue']) / df.iloc[0]['Revenue']
sheet['C5'] = growth  # Hardcodes 0.15

# Bad: Python calculation for average
avg = sum(values) / len(values)
sheet['D20'] = avg  # Hardcodes 42.5
\`\`\`

### ✅ CORRECT - Using Excel Formulas
\`\`\`python
# Good: Let Excel calculate the sum
sheet['B10'] = '=SUM(B2:B9)'

# Good: Growth rate as Excel formula
sheet['C5'] = '=(C4-C2)/C2'

# Good: Average using Excel function
sheet['D20'] = '=AVERAGE(D2:D19)'
\`\`\`

This applies to ALL calculations - totals, percentages, ratios, differences, etc. The spreadsheet should be able to recalculate when source data changes.

## Common Workflow
1. **Choose tool**: pandas for data, openpyxl for formulas/formatting
2. **Create/Load**: Create new workbook or load existing file
3. **Modify**: Add/edit data, formulas, and formatting
4. **Save**: Write to file
5. **Recalculate formulas (MANDATORY IF USING FORMULAS)**: Use the scripts/recalc.py script
   \`\`\`bash
   python scripts/recalc.py output.xlsx
   \`\`\`
6. **Verify and fix any errors**: 
   - The script returns JSON with error details
   - If \`status\` is \`errors_found\`, check \`error_summary\` for specific error types and locations
   - Fix the identified errors and recalculate again
   - Common errors to fix:
     - \`#REF!\`: Invalid cell references
     - \`#DIV/0!\`: Division by zero
     - \`#VALUE!\`: Wrong data type in formula
     - \`#NAME?\`: Unrecognized formula name

### Creating new Excel files

\`\`\`python
# Using openpyxl for formulas and formatting
from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.styles import Font, PatternFill, Alignment

wb = Workbook()
sheet = wb.active

# Add data
sheet['A1'] = 'Hello'
sheet['B1'] = 'World'
sheet.append(['Row', 'of', 'data'])

# Add formula
sheet['B2'] = '=SUM(A1:A10)'

# Formatting
sheet['A1'].font = Font(bold=True, color='FF0000')
sheet['A1'].fill = PatternFill('solid', start_color='FFFF00')
sheet['A1'].alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center')

# Column width
sheet.column_dimensions['A'].width = 20

wb.save('output.xlsx')
\`\`\`

### Editing existing Excel files

\`\`\`python
# Using openpyxl to preserve formulas and formatting
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Load existing file
wb = load_workbook('existing.xlsx')
sheet = wb.active  # or wb['SheetName'] for specific sheet

# Working with multiple sheets
for sheet_name in wb.sheetnames:
    sheet = wb[sheet_name]
    print(f"Sheet: {sheet_name}")

# Modify cells
sheet['A1'] = 'New Value'
sheet.insert_rows(2)  # Insert row at position 2
sheet.delete_cols(3)  # Delete column 3

# Add new sheet
new_sheet = wb.create_sheet('NewSheet')
new_sheet['A1'] = 'Data'

wb.save('modified.xlsx')
\`\`\`

## Recalculating formulas

Excel files created or modified by openpyxl contain formulas as strings but not calculated values. Use the provided \`scripts/recalc.py\` script to recalculate formulas:

\`\`\`bash
python scripts/recalc.py <excel_file> [timeout_seconds]
\`\`\`

Example:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/recalc.py output.xlsx 30
\`\`\`

The script:
- Automatically sets up LibreOffice macro on first run
- Recalculates all formulas in all sheets
- Scans ALL cells for Excel errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.)
- Returns JSON with detailed error locations and counts
- Works on both Linux and macOS

## Formula Verification Checklist

Quick checks to ensure formulas work correctly:

### Essential Verification
- [ ] **Test 2-3 sample references**: Verify they pull correct values before building full model
- [ ] **Column mapping**: Confirm Excel columns match (e.g., column 64 = BL, not BK)
- [ ] **Row offset**: Remember Excel rows are 1-indexed (DataFrame row 5 = Excel row 6)

### Common Pitfalls
- [ ] **NaN handling**: Check for null values with \`pd.notna()\`
- [ ] **Far-right columns**: FY data often in columns 50+ 
- [ ] **Multiple matches**: Search all occurrences, not just first
- [ ] **Division by zero**: Check denominators before using \`/\` in formulas (#DIV/0!)
- [ ] **Wrong references**: Verify all cell references point to intended cells (#REF!)
- [ ] **Cross-sheet references**: Use correct format (Sheet1!A1) for linking sheets

### Formula Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Start small**: Test formulas on 2-3 cells before applying broadly
- [ ] **Verify dependencies**: Check all cells referenced in formulas exist
- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Include zero, negative, and very large values

### Interpreting scripts/recalc.py Output
The script returns JSON with error details:
\`\`\`json
{
  "status": "success",           // or "errors_found"
  "total_errors": 0,              // Total error count
  "total_formulas": 42,           // Number of formulas in file
  "error_summary": {              // Only present if errors found
    "#REF!": {
      "count": 2,
      "locations": ["Sheet1!B5", "Sheet1!C10"]
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### Library Selection
- **pandas**: Best for data analysis, bulk operations, and simple data export
- **openpyxl**: Best for complex formatting, formulas, and Excel-specific features

### Working with openpyxl
- Cell indices are 1-based (row=1, column=1 refers to cell A1)
- Use \`data_only=True\` to read calculated values: \`load_workbook('file.xlsx', data_only=True)\`
- **Warning**: If opened with \`data_only=True\` and saved, formulas are replaced with values and permanently lost
- For large files: Use \`read_only=True\` for reading or \`write_only=True\` for writing
- Formulas are preserved but not evaluated - use scripts/recalc.py to update values

### Working with pandas
- Specify data types to avoid inference issues: \`pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', dtype={'id': str})\`
- For large files, read specific columns: \`pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', usecols=['A', 'C', 'E'])\`
- Handle dates properly: \`pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', parse_dates=['date_column'])\`

## Code Style Guidelines
**IMPORTANT**: When generating Python code for Excel operations:
- Write minimal, concise Python code without unnecessary comments
- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations
- Avoid unnecessary print statements

**For Excel files themselves**:
- Add comments to cells with complex formulas or important assumptions
- Document data sources for hardcoded values
- Include notes for key calculations and model sections`,

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.`,

These are instructions for creating design philosophies - aesthetic movements that are then EXPRESSED VISUALLY. Output only .md files, .pdf files, and .png files.

Complete this in two steps:
1. Design Philosophy Creation (.md file)
2. Express by creating it on a canvas (.pdf file or .png file)

First, undertake this task:

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY CREATION

To begin, create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY (not layouts or templates) that will be interpreted through:
- Form, space, color, composition
- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns
- Minimal text as visual accent

### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING
- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user that should be taken into account, but used as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.
- What is created: A design philosophy/aesthetic movement.
- What happens next: Then, the same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT VISUALLY - creating artifacts that are 90% visual design, 10% essential text.

Consider this approach:
- Write a manifesto for an art movement
- The next phase involves making the artwork

The philosophy must emphasize: Visual expression. Spatial communication. Artistic interpretation. Minimal words.

### HOW TO GENERATE A VISUAL PHILOSOPHY

**Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Brutalist Joy" / "Chromatic Silence" / "Metabolist Dreams"

**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):

To capture the VISUAL essence, express how the philosophy manifests through:
- Space and form
- Color and material
- Scale and rhythm
- Composition and balance
- Visual hierarchy

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**
- **Avoid redundancy**: Each design aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating points about color theory, spatial relationships, or typographic principles unless adding new depth.
- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final work should appear as though it took countless hours to create, was labored over with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like "meticulously crafted," "the product of deep expertise," "painstaking attention," "master-level execution."
- **Leave creative space**: Remain specific about the aesthetic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive choices also at a extremely high level of craftmanship.

The philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas VISUALLY, not through text. Information lives in design, not paragraphs.

### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES

**"Concrete Poetry"**
Philosophy: Communication through monumental form and bold geometry.
Visual expression: Massive color blocks, sculptural typography (huge single words, tiny labels), Brutalist spatial divisions, Polish poster energy meets Le Corbusier. Ideas expressed through visual weight and spatial tension, not explanation. Text as rare, powerful gesture - never paragraphs, only essential words integrated into the visual architecture. Every element placed with the precision of a master craftsman.

**"Chromatic Language"**
Philosophy: Color as the primary information system.
Visual expression: Geometric precision where color zones create meaning. Typography minimal - small sans-serif labels letting chromatic fields communicate. Think Josef Albers' interaction meets data visualization. Information encoded spatially and chromatically. Words only to anchor what color already shows. The result of painstaking chromatic calibration.

**"Analog Meditation"**
Philosophy: Quiet visual contemplation through texture and breathing room.
Visual expression: Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space. Photography and illustration dominate. Typography whispered (small, restrained, serving the visual). Japanese photobook aesthetic. Images breathe across pages. Text appears sparingly - short phrases, never explanatory blocks. Each composition balanced with the care of a meditation practice.

**"Organic Systems"**
Philosophy: Natural clustering and modular growth patterns.
Visual expression: Rounded forms, organic arrangements, color from nature through architecture. Information shown through visual diagrams, spatial relationships, iconography. Text only for key labels floating in space. The composition tells the story through expert spatial orchestration.

**"Geometric Silence"**
Philosophy: Pure order and restraint.
Visual expression: Grid-based precision, bold photography or stark graphics, dramatic negative space. Typography precise but minimal - small essential text, large quiet zones. Swiss formalism meets Brutalist material honesty. Structure communicates, not words. Every alignment the work of countless refinements.

*These are condensed examples. The actual design philosophy should be 4-6 substantial paragraphs.*

### ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES
- **VISUAL PHILOSOPHY**: Create an aesthetic worldview to be expressed through design
- **MINIMAL TEXT**: Always emphasize that text is sparse, essential-only, integrated as visual element - never lengthy
- **SPATIAL EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through space, form, color, composition - not paragraphs
- **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: The next Claude interprets the philosophy visually - provide creative room
- **PURE DESIGN**: This is about making ART OBJECTS, not documents with decoration
- **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Repeatedly emphasize the final work must look meticulously crafted, labored over with care, the product of countless hours by someone at the top of their field

**The design philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs long.** Fill it with poetic design philosophy that brings together the core vision. Avoid repeating the same points. Keep the design philosophy generic without mentioning the intention of the art, as if it can be used wherever. Output the design philosophy as a .md file.

---

## DEDUCING THE SUBTLE REFERENCE

**CRITICAL STEP**: Before creating the canvas, identify the subtle conceptual thread from the original request.

**THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE**:
The topic is a **subtle, niche reference embedded within the art itself** - not always literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others simply experience a masterful abstract composition. The design philosophy provides the aesthetic language. The deduced topic provides the soul - the quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into form, color, and composition.

This is **VERY IMPORTANT**: The reference must be refined so it enhances the work's depth without announcing itself. Think like a jazz musician quoting another song - only those who know will catch it, but everyone appreciates the music.

---

## CANVAS CREATION

With both the philosophy and the conceptual framework established, express it on a canvas. Take a moment to gather thoughts and clear the mind. Use the design philosophy created and the instructions below to craft a masterpiece, embodying all aspects of the philosophy with expert craftsmanship.

**IMPORTANT**: For any type of content, even if the user requests something for a movie/game/book, the approach should still be sophisticated. Never lose sight of the idea that this should be art, not something that's cartoony or amateur.

To create museum or magazine quality work, use the design philosophy as the foundation. Create one single page, highly visual, design-forward PDF or PNG output (unless asked for more pages). Generally use repeating patterns and perfect shapes. Treat the abstract philosophical design as if it were a scientific bible, borrowing the visual language of systematic observation—dense accumulation of marks, repeated elements, or layered patterns that build meaning through patient repetition and reward sustained viewing. Add sparse, clinical typography and systematic reference markers that suggest this could be a diagram from an imaginary discipline, treating the invisible subject with the same reverence typically reserved for documenting observable phenomena. Anchor the piece with simple phrase(s) or details positioned subtly, using a limited color palette that feels intentional and cohesive. Embrace the paradox of using analytical visual language to express ideas about human experience: the result should feel like an artifact that proves something ephemeral can be studied, mapped, and understood through careful attention. This is true art. 

**Text as a contextual element**: Text is always minimal and visual-first, but let context guide whether that means whisper-quiet labels or bold typographic gestures. A punk venue poster might have larger, more aggressive type than a minimalist ceramics studio identity. Most of the time, font should be thin. All use of fonts must be design-forward and prioritize visual communication. Regardless of text scale, nothing falls off the page and nothing overlaps. Every element must be contained within the canvas boundaries with proper margins. Check carefully that all text, graphics, and visual elements have breathing room and clear separation. This is non-negotiable for professional execution. **IMPORTANT: Use different fonts if writing text. Search the \`./canvas-fonts\` directory. Regardless of approach, sophistication is non-negotiable.**

Download and use whatever fonts are needed to make this a reality. Get creative by making the typography actually part of the art itself -- if the art is abstract, bring the font onto the canvas, not typeset digitally.

To push boundaries, follow design instinct/intuition while using the philosophy as a guiding principle. Embrace ultimate design freedom and choice. Push aesthetics and design to the frontier. 

**CRITICAL**: To achieve human-crafted quality (not AI-generated), create work that looks like it took countless hours. Make it appear as though someone at the absolute top of their field labored over every detail with painstaking care. Ensure the composition, spacing, color choices, typography - everything screams expert-level craftsmanship. Double-check that nothing overlaps, formatting is flawless, every detail perfect. Create something that could be shown to people to prove expertise and rank as undeniably impressive.

Output the final result as a single, downloadable .pdf or .png file, alongside the design philosophy used as a .md file.

---

## FINAL STEP

**IMPORTANT**: The user ALREADY said "It isn't perfect enough. It must be pristine, a masterpiece if craftsmanship, as if it were about to be displayed in a museum."

**CRITICAL**: To refine the work, avoid adding more graphics; instead refine what has been created and make it extremely crisp, respecting the design philosophy and the principles of minimalism entirely. Rather than adding a fun filter or refactoring a font, consider how to make the existing composition more cohesive with the art. If the instinct is to call a new function or draw a new shape, STOP and instead ask: "How can I make what's already here more of a piece of art?"

Take a second pass. Go back to the code and refine/polish further to make this a philosophically designed masterpiece.

## MULTI-PAGE OPTION

To create additional pages when requested, create more creative pages along the same lines as the design philosophy but distinctly different as well. Bundle those pages in the same .pdf or many .pngs. Treat the first page as just a single page in a whole coffee table book waiting to be filled. Make the next pages unique twists and memories of the original. Have them almost tell a story in a very tasteful way. Exercise full creative freedom.`,

Algorithmic philosophies are computational aesthetic movements that are then expressed through code. Output .md files (philosophy), .html files (interactive viewer), and .js files (generative algorithms).

This happens in two steps:
1. Algorithmic Philosophy Creation (.md file)
2. Express by creating p5.js generative art (.html + .js files)

First, undertake this task:

## ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY CREATION

To begin, create an ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY (not static images or templates) that will be interpreted through:
- Computational processes, emergent behavior, mathematical beauty
- Seeded randomness, noise fields, organic systems
- Particles, flows, fields, forces
- Parametric variation and controlled chaos

### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING
- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user to take into account, but use as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.
- What is created: An algorithmic philosophy/generative aesthetic movement.
- What happens next: The same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT IN CODE - creating p5.js sketches that are 90% algorithmic generation, 10% essential parameters.

Consider this approach:
- Write a manifesto for a generative art movement
- The next phase involves writing the algorithm that brings it to life

The philosophy must emphasize: Algorithmic expression. Emergent behavior. Computational beauty. Seeded variation.

### HOW TO GENERATE AN ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY

**Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Organic Turbulence" / "Quantum Harmonics" / "Emergent Stillness"

**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):

To capture the ALGORITHMIC essence, express how this philosophy manifests through:
- Computational processes and mathematical relationships?
- Noise functions and randomness patterns?
- Particle behaviors and field dynamics?
- Temporal evolution and system states?
- Parametric variation and emergent complexity?

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**
- **Avoid redundancy**: Each algorithmic aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating concepts about noise theory, particle dynamics, or mathematical principles unless adding new depth.
- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final algorithm should appear as though it took countless hours to develop, was refined with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like "meticulously crafted algorithm," "the product of deep computational expertise," "painstaking optimization," "master-level implementation."
- **Leave creative space**: Be specific about the algorithmic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive implementation choices at an extremely high level of craftsmanship.

The philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas ALGORITHMICALLY, not through static images. Beauty lives in the process, not the final frame.

### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES

**"Organic Turbulence"**
Philosophy: Chaos constrained by natural law, order emerging from disorder.
Algorithmic expression: Flow fields driven by layered Perlin noise. Thousands of particles following vector forces, their trails accumulating into organic density maps. Multiple noise octaves create turbulent regions and calm zones. Color emerges from velocity and density - fast particles burn bright, slow ones fade to shadow. The algorithm runs until equilibrium - a meticulously tuned balance where every parameter was refined through countless iterations by a master of computational aesthetics.

**"Quantum Harmonics"**
Philosophy: Discrete entities exhibiting wave-like interference patterns.
Algorithmic expression: Particles initialized on a grid, each carrying a phase value that evolves through sine waves. When particles are near, their phases interfere - constructive interference creates bright nodes, destructive creates voids. Simple harmonic motion generates complex emergent mandalas. The result of painstaking frequency calibration where every ratio was carefully chosen to produce resonant beauty.

**"Recursive Whispers"**
Philosophy: Self-similarity across scales, infinite depth in finite space.
Algorithmic expression: Branching structures that subdivide recursively. Each branch slightly randomized but constrained by golden ratios. L-systems or recursive subdivision generate tree-like forms that feel both mathematical and organic. Subtle noise perturbations break perfect symmetry. Line weights diminish with each recursion level. Every branching angle the product of deep mathematical exploration.

**"Field Dynamics"**
Philosophy: Invisible forces made visible through their effects on matter.
Algorithmic expression: Vector fields constructed from mathematical functions or noise. Particles born at edges, flowing along field lines, dying when they reach equilibrium or boundaries. Multiple fields can attract, repel, or rotate particles. The visualization shows only the traces - ghost-like evidence of invisible forces. A computational dance meticulously choreographed through force balance.

**"Stochastic Crystallization"**
Philosophy: Random processes crystallizing into ordered structures.
Algorithmic expression: Randomized circle packing or Voronoi tessellation. Start with random points, let them evolve through relaxation algorithms. Cells push apart until equilibrium. Color based on cell size, neighbor count, or distance from center. The organic tiling that emerges feels both random and inevitable. Every seed produces unique crystalline beauty - the mark of a master-level generative algorithm.

*These are condensed examples. The actual algorithmic philosophy should be 4-6 substantial paragraphs.*

### ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES
- **ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY**: Creating a computational worldview to be expressed through code
- **PROCESS OVER PRODUCT**: Always emphasize that beauty emerges from the algorithm's execution - each run is unique
- **PARAMETRIC EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through mathematical relationships, forces, behaviors - not static composition
- **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: The next Claude interprets the philosophy algorithmically - provide creative implementation room
- **PURE GENERATIVE ART**: This is about making LIVING ALGORITHMS, not static images with randomness
- **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Repeatedly emphasize the final algorithm must feel meticulously crafted, refined through countless iterations, the product of deep expertise by someone at the absolute top of their field in computational aesthetics

**The algorithmic philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs long.** Fill it with poetic computational philosophy that brings together the intended vision. Avoid repeating the same points. Output this algorithmic philosophy as a .md file.

---

## DEDUCING THE CONCEPTUAL SEED

**CRITICAL STEP**: Before implementing the algorithm, identify the subtle conceptual thread from the original request.

**THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE**:
The concept is a **subtle, niche reference embedded within the algorithm itself** - not always literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others simply experience a masterful generative composition. The algorithmic philosophy provides the computational language. The deduced concept provides the soul - the quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into parameters, behaviors, and emergence patterns.

This is **VERY IMPORTANT**: The reference must be so refined that it enhances the work's depth without announcing itself. Think like a jazz musician quoting another song through algorithmic harmony - only those who know will catch it, but everyone appreciates the generative beauty.

---

## P5.JS IMPLEMENTATION

With the philosophy AND conceptual framework established, express it through code. Pause to gather thoughts before proceeding. Use only the algorithmic philosophy created and the instructions below.

### ⚠️ STEP 0: READ THE TEMPLATE FIRST ⚠️

**CRITICAL: BEFORE writing any HTML:**

1. **Read** \`templates/viewer.html\` using the Read tool
2. **Study** the exact structure, styling, and Anthropic branding
3. **Use that file as the LITERAL STARTING POINT** - not just inspiration
4. **Keep all FIXED sections exactly as shown** (header, sidebar structure, Anthropic colors/fonts, seed controls, action buttons)
5. **Replace only the VARIABLE sections** marked in the file's comments (algorithm, parameters, UI controls for parameters)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Creating HTML from scratch
- ❌ Inventing custom styling or color schemes
- ❌ Using system fonts or dark themes
- ❌ Changing the sidebar structure

**Follow these practices:**
- ✅ Copy the template's exact HTML structure
- ✅ Keep Anthropic branding (Poppins/Lora fonts, light colors, gradient backdrop)
- ✅ Maintain the sidebar layout (Seed → Parameters → Colors? → Actions)
- ✅ Replace only the p5.js algorithm and parameter controls

The template is the foundation. Build on it, don't rebuild it.

---

To create gallery-quality computational art that lives and breathes, use the algorithmic philosophy as the foundation.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**Seeded Randomness (Art Blocks Pattern)**:
\`\`\`javascript
// ALWAYS use a seed for reproducibility
let seed = 12345; // or hash from user input
randomSeed(seed);
noiseSeed(seed);
\`\`\`

**Parameter Structure - FOLLOW THE PHILOSOPHY**:

To establish parameters that emerge naturally from the algorithmic philosophy, consider: "What qualities of this system can be adjusted?"

\`\`\`javascript
let params = {
  seed: 12345,  // Always include seed for reproducibility
  // colors
  // Add parameters that control YOUR algorithm:
  // - Quantities (how many?)
  // - Scales (how big? how fast?)
  // - Probabilities (how likely?)
  // - Ratios (what proportions?)
  // - Angles (what direction?)
  // - Thresholds (when does behavior change?)
};
\`\`\`

**To design effective parameters, focus on the properties the system needs to be tunable rather than thinking in terms of "pattern types".**

**Core Algorithm - EXPRESS THE PHILOSOPHY**:

**CRITICAL**: The algorithmic philosophy should dictate what to build.

To express the philosophy through code, avoid thinking "which pattern should I use?" and instead think "how to express this philosophy through code?"

If the philosophy is about **organic emergence**, consider using:
- Elements that accumulate or grow over time
- Random processes constrained by natural rules
- Feedback loops and interactions

If the philosophy is about **mathematical beauty**, consider using:
- Geometric relationships and ratios
- Trigonometric functions and harmonics
- Precise calculations creating unexpected patterns

If the philosophy is about **controlled chaos**, consider using:
- Random variation within strict boundaries
- Bifurcation and phase transitions
- Order emerging from disorder

**The algorithm flows from the philosophy, not from a menu of options.**

To guide the implementation, let the conceptual essence inform creative and original choices. Build something that expresses the vision for this particular request.

**Canvas Setup**: Standard p5.js structure:
\`\`\`javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(1200, 1200);
  // Initialize your system
}

function draw() {
  // Your generative algorithm
  // Can be static (noLoop) or animated
}
\`\`\`

### CRAFTSMANSHIP REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL**: To achieve mastery, create algorithms that feel like they emerged through countless iterations by a master generative artist. Tune every parameter carefully. Ensure every pattern emerges with purpose. This is NOT random noise - this is CONTROLLED CHAOS refined through deep expertise.

- **Balance**: Complexity without visual noise, order without rigidity
- **Color Harmony**: Thoughtful palettes, not random RGB values
- **Composition**: Even in randomness, maintain visual hierarchy and flow
- **Performance**: Smooth execution, optimized for real-time if animated
- **Reproducibility**: Same seed ALWAYS produces identical output

### OUTPUT FORMAT

Output:
1. **Algorithmic Philosophy** - As markdown or text explaining the generative aesthetic
2. **Single HTML Artifact** - Self-contained interactive generative art built from \`templates/viewer.html\` (see STEP 0 and next section)

The HTML artifact contains everything: p5.js (from CDN), the algorithm, parameter controls, and UI - all in one file that works immediately in claude.ai artifacts or any browser. Start from the template file, not from scratch.

---

## INTERACTIVE ARTIFACT CREATION

**REMINDER: \`templates/viewer.html\` should have already been read (see STEP 0). Use that file as the starting point.**

To allow exploration of the generative art, create a single, self-contained HTML artifact. Ensure this artifact works immediately in claude.ai or any browser - no setup required. Embed everything inline.

### CRITICAL: WHAT'S FIXED VS VARIABLE

The \`templates/viewer.html\` file is the foundation. It contains the exact structure and styling needed.

**FIXED (always include exactly as shown):**
- Layout structure (header, sidebar, main canvas area)
- Anthropic branding (UI colors, fonts, gradients)
- Seed section in sidebar:
  - Seed display
  - Previous/Next buttons
  - Random button
  - Jump to seed input + Go button
- Actions section in sidebar:
  - Regenerate button
  - Reset button

**VARIABLE (customize for each artwork):**
- The entire p5.js algorithm (setup/draw/classes)
- The parameters object (define what the art needs)
- The Parameters section in sidebar:
  - Number of parameter controls
  - Parameter names
  - Min/max/step values for sliders
  - Control types (sliders, inputs, etc.)
- Colors section (optional):
  - Some art needs color pickers
  - Some art might use fixed colors
  - Some art might be monochrome (no color controls needed)
  - Decide based on the art's needs

**Every artwork should have unique parameters and algorithm!** The fixed parts provide consistent UX - everything else expresses the unique vision.

### REQUIRED FEATURES

**1. Parameter Controls**
- Sliders for numeric parameters (particle count, noise scale, speed, etc.)
- Color pickers for palette colors
- Real-time updates when parameters change
- Reset button to restore defaults

**2. Seed Navigation**
- Display current seed number
- "Previous" and "Next" buttons to cycle through seeds
- "Random" button for random seed
- Input field to jump to specific seed
- Generate 100 variations when requested (seeds 1-100)

**3. Single Artifact Structure**
\`\`\`html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- p5.js from CDN - always available -->
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.7.0/p5.min.js"></script>
  <style>
    /* All styling inline - clean, minimal */
    /* Canvas on top, controls below */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="canvas-container"></div>
  <div id="controls">
    <!-- All parameter controls -->
  </div>
  <script>
    // ALL p5.js code inline here
    // Parameter objects, classes, functions
    // setup() and draw()
    // UI handlers
    // Everything self-contained
  </script>
</body>
</html>
\`\`\`

**CRITICAL**: This is a single artifact. No external files, no imports (except p5.js CDN). Everything inline.

**4. Implementation Details - BUILD THE SIDEBAR**

The sidebar structure:

**1. Seed (FIXED)** - Always include exactly as shown:
- Seed display
- Prev/Next/Random/Jump buttons

**2. Parameters (VARIABLE)** - Create controls for the art:
\`\`\`html
<div class="control-group">
    <label>Parameter Name</label>
    <input type="range" id="param" min="..." max="..." step="..." value="..." oninput="updateParam('param', this.value)">
    <span class="value-display" id="param-value">...</span>
</div>
\`\`\`
Add as many control-group divs as there are parameters.

**3. Colors (OPTIONAL/VARIABLE)** - Include if the art needs adjustable colors:
- Add color pickers if users should control palette
- Skip this section if the art uses fixed colors
- Skip if the art is monochrome

**4. Actions (FIXED)** - Always include exactly as shown:
- Regenerate button
- Reset button
- Download PNG button

**Requirements**:
- Seed controls must work (prev/next/random/jump/display)
- All parameters must have UI controls
- Regenerate, Reset, Download buttons must work
- Keep Anthropic branding (UI styling, not art colors)

### USING THE ARTIFACT

The HTML artifact works immediately:
1. **In claude.ai**: Displayed as an interactive artifact - runs instantly
2. **As a file**: Save and open in any browser - no server needed
3. **Sharing**: Send the HTML file - it's completely self-contained

---

## VARIATIONS & EXPLORATION

The artifact includes seed navigation by default (prev/next/random buttons), allowing users to explore variations without creating multiple files. If the user wants specific variations highlighted:

- Include seed presets (buttons for "Variation 1: Seed 42", "Variation 2: Seed 127", etc.)
- Add a "Gallery Mode" that shows thumbnails of multiple seeds side-by-side
- All within the same single artifact

This is like creating a series of prints from the same plate - the algorithm is consistent, but each seed reveals different facets of its potential. The interactive nature means users discover their own favorites by exploring the seed space.

---

## THE CREATIVE PROCESS

**User request** → **Algorithmic philosophy** → **Implementation**

Each request is unique. The process involves:

1. **Interpret the user's intent** - What aesthetic is being sought?
2. **Create an algorithmic philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs) describing the computational approach
3. **Implement it in code** - Build the algorithm that expresses this philosophy
4. **Design appropriate parameters** - What should be tunable?
5. **Build matching UI controls** - Sliders/inputs for those parameters

**The constants**:
- Anthropic branding (colors, fonts, layout)
- Seed navigation (always present)
- Self-contained HTML artifact

**Everything else is variable**:
- The algorithm itself
- The parameters
- The UI controls
- The visual outcome

To achieve the best results, trust creativity and let the philosophy guide the implementation.

---

## RESOURCES

This skill includes helpful templates and documentation:

- **templates/viewer.html**: REQUIRED STARTING POINT for all HTML artifacts.
  - This is the foundation - contains the exact structure and Anthropic branding
  - **Keep unchanged**: Layout structure, sidebar organization, Anthropic colors/fonts, seed controls, action buttons
  - **Replace**: The p5.js algorithm, parameter definitions, and UI controls in Parameters section
  - The extensive comments in the file mark exactly what to keep vs replace

- **templates/generator_template.js**: Reference for p5.js best practices and code structure principles.
  - Shows how to organize parameters, use seeded randomness, structure classes
  - NOT a pattern menu - use these principles to build unique algorithms
  - Embed algorithms inline in the HTML artifact (don't create separate .js files)

**Critical reminder**:
- The **template is the STARTING POINT**, not inspiration
- The **algorithm is where to create** something unique
- Don't copy the flow field example - build what the philosophy demands
- But DO keep the exact UI structure and Anthropic branding from the template`,

1. Read the corresponding theme file from the \`themes/\` directory
2. Apply the specified colors and fonts consistently throughout the deck
3. Ensure proper contrast and readability
4. Maintain the theme's visual identity across all slides

## Create your Own Theme
To handle cases where none of the existing themes work for an artifact, create a custom theme. Based on provided inputs, generate a new theme similar to the ones above. Give the theme a similar name describing what the font/color combinations represent. Use any basic description provided to choose appropriate colors/fonts. After generating the theme, show it for review and verification. Following that, apply the theme as described above.`,

# Slack GIF Creator

A toolkit providing utilities and knowledge for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack.

## Slack Requirements

**Dimensions:**
- Emoji GIFs: 128x128 (recommended)
- Message GIFs: 480x480

**Parameters:**
- FPS: 10-30 (lower is smaller file size)
- Colors: 48-128 (fewer = smaller file size)
- Duration: Keep under 3 seconds for emoji GIFs

## Core Workflow

\`\`\`python
from core.gif_builder import GIFBuilder
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

# 1. Create builder
builder = GIFBuilder(width=128, height=128, fps=10)

# 2. Generate frames
for i in range(12):
    frame = Image.new('RGB', (128, 128), (240, 248, 255))
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(frame)

    # Draw your animation using PIL primitives
    # (circles, polygons, lines, etc.)

    builder.add_frame(frame)

# 3. Save with optimization
builder.save('output.gif', num_colors=48, optimize_for_emoji=True)
\`\`\`

## Drawing Graphics

### Working with User-Uploaded Images
If a user uploads an image, consider whether they want to:
- **Use it directly** (e.g., "animate this", "split this into frames")
- **Use it as inspiration** (e.g., "make something like this")

Load and work with images using PIL:
\`\`\`python
from PIL import Image

uploaded = Image.open('file.png')
# Use directly, or just as reference for colors/style
\`\`\`

### Drawing from Scratch
When drawing graphics from scratch, use PIL ImageDraw primitives:

\`\`\`python
from PIL import ImageDraw

draw = ImageDraw.Draw(frame)

# Circles/ovals
draw.ellipse([x1, y1, x2, y2], fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)

# Stars, triangles, any polygon
points = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), ...]
draw.polygon(points, fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)

# Lines
draw.line([(x1, y1), (x2, y2)], fill=(r, g, b), width=5)

# Rectangles
draw.rectangle([x1, y1, x2, y2], fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)
\`\`\`

**Don't use:** Emoji fonts (unreliable across platforms) or assume pre-packaged graphics exist in this skill.

### Making Graphics Look Good

Graphics should look polished and creative, not basic. Here's how:

**Use thicker lines** - Always set \`width=2\` or higher for outlines and lines. Thin lines (width=1) look choppy and amateurish.

**Add visual depth**:
- Use gradients for backgrounds (\`create_gradient_background\`)
- Layer multiple shapes for complexity (e.g., a star with a smaller star inside)

**Make shapes more interesting**:
- Don't just draw a plain circle - add highlights, rings, or patterns
- Stars can have glows (draw larger, semi-transparent versions behind)
- Combine multiple shapes (stars + sparkles, circles + rings)

**Pay attention to colors**:
- Use vibrant, complementary colors
- Add contrast (dark outlines on light shapes, light outlines on dark shapes)
- Consider the overall composition

**For complex shapes** (hearts, snowflakes, etc.):
- Use combinations of polygons and ellipses
- Calculate points carefully for symmetry
- Add details (a heart can have a highlight curve, snowflakes have intricate branches)

Be creative and detailed! A good Slack GIF should look polished, not like placeholder graphics.

## Available Utilities

### GIFBuilder (\`core.gif_builder\`)
Assembles frames and optimizes for Slack:
\`\`\`python
builder = GIFBuilder(width=128, height=128, fps=10)
builder.add_frame(frame)  # Add PIL Image
builder.add_frames(frames)  # Add list of frames
builder.save('out.gif', num_colors=48, optimize_for_emoji=True, remove_duplicates=True)
\`\`\`

### Validators (\`core.validators\`)
Check if GIF meets Slack requirements:
\`\`\`python
from core.validators import validate_gif, is_slack_ready

# Detailed validation
passes, info = validate_gif('my.gif', is_emoji=True, verbose=True)

# Quick check
if is_slack_ready('my.gif'):
    print("Ready!")
\`\`\`

### Easing Functions (\`core.easing\`)
Smooth motion instead of linear:
\`\`\`python
from core.easing import interpolate

# Progress from 0.0 to 1.0
t = i / (num_frames - 1)

# Apply easing
y = interpolate(start=0, end=400, t=t, easing='ease_out')

# Available: linear, ease_in, ease_out, ease_in_out,
#           bounce_out, elastic_out, back_out
\`\`\`

### Frame Helpers (\`core.frame_composer\`)
Convenience functions for common needs:
\`\`\`python
from core.frame_composer import (
    create_blank_frame,         # Solid color background
    create_gradient_background,  # Vertical gradient
    draw_circle,                # Helper for circles
    draw_text,                  # Simple text rendering
    draw_star                   # 5-pointed star
)
\`\`\`

## Animation Concepts

### Shake/Vibrate
Offset object position with oscillation:
- Use \`math.sin()\` or \`math.cos()\` with frame index
- Add small random variations for natural feel
- Apply to x and/or y position

### Pulse/Heartbeat
Scale object size rhythmically:
- Use \`math.sin(t * frequency * 2 * math.pi)\` for smooth pulse
- For heartbeat: two quick pulses then pause (adjust sine wave)
- Scale between 0.8 and 1.2 of base size

### Bounce
Object falls and bounces:
- Use \`interpolate()\` with \`easing='bounce_out'\` for landing
- Use \`easing='ease_in'\` for falling (accelerating)
- Apply gravity by increasing y velocity each frame

### Spin/Rotate
Rotate object around center:
- PIL: \`image.rotate(angle, resample=Image.BICUBIC)\`
- For wobble: use sine wave for angle instead of linear

### Fade In/Out
Gradually appear or disappear:
- Create RGBA image, adjust alpha channel
- Or use \`Image.blend(image1, image2, alpha)\`
- Fade in: alpha from 0 to 1
- Fade out: alpha from 1 to 0

### Slide
Move object from off-screen to position:
- Start position: outside frame bounds
- End position: target location
- Use \`interpolate()\` with \`easing='ease_out'\` for smooth stop
- For overshoot: use \`easing='back_out'\`

### Zoom
Scale and position for zoom effect:
- Zoom in: scale from 0.1 to 2.0, crop center
- Zoom out: scale from 2.0 to 1.0
- Can add motion blur for drama (PIL filter)

### Explode/Particle Burst
Create particles radiating outward:
- Generate particles with random angles and velocities
- Update each particle: \`x += vx\`, \`y += vy\`
- Add gravity: \`vy += gravity_constant\`
- Fade out particles over time (reduce alpha)

## Optimization Strategies

Only when asked to make the file size smaller, implement a few of the following methods:

1. **Fewer frames** - Lower FPS (10 instead of 20) or shorter duration
2. **Fewer colors** - \`num_colors=48\` instead of 128
3. **Smaller dimensions** - 128x128 instead of 480x480
4. **Remove duplicates** - \`remove_duplicates=True\` in save()
5. **Emoji mode** - \`optimize_for_emoji=True\` auto-optimizes

\`\`\`python
# Maximum optimization for emoji
builder.save(
    'emoji.gif',
    num_colors=48,
    optimize_for_emoji=True,
    remove_duplicates=True
)
\`\`\`

## Philosophy

This skill provides:
- **Knowledge**: Slack's requirements and animation concepts
- **Utilities**: GIFBuilder, validators, easing functions
- **Flexibility**: Create the animation logic using PIL primitives

It does NOT provide:
- Rigid animation templates or pre-made functions
- Emoji font rendering (unreliable across platforms)
- A library of pre-packaged graphics built into the skill

**Note on user uploads**: This skill doesn't include pre-built graphics, but if a user uploads an image, use PIL to load and work with it - interpret based on their request whether they want it used directly or just as inspiration.

Be creative! Combine concepts (bouncing + rotating, pulsing + sliding, etc.) and use PIL's full capabilities.

# MCP Server Development Guide

## Overview

Create MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable LLMs to interact with external services through well-designed tools. The quality of an MCP server is measured by how well it enables LLMs to accomplish real-world tasks.

---

# Process

## 🚀 High-Level Workflow

Creating a high-quality MCP server involves four main phases:

### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning

#### 1.1 Understand Modern MCP Design

**API Coverage vs. Workflow Tools:**
Balance comprehensive API endpoint coverage with specialized workflow tools. Workflow tools can be more convenient for specific tasks, while comprehensive coverage gives agents flexibility to compose operations. Performance varies by client—some clients benefit from code execution that combines basic tools, while others work better with higher-level workflows. When uncertain, prioritize comprehensive API coverage.

**Tool Naming and Discoverability:**
Clear, descriptive tool names help agents find the right tools quickly. Use consistent prefixes (e.g., \`github_create_issue\`, \`github_list_repos\`) and action-oriented naming.

**Context Management:**
Agents benefit from concise tool descriptions and the ability to filter/paginate results. Design tools that return focused, relevant data. Some clients support code execution which can help agents filter and process data efficiently.

**Actionable Error Messages:**
Error messages should guide agents toward solutions with specific suggestions and next steps.

#### 1.2 Study MCP Protocol Documentation

**Navigate the MCP specification:**

Start with the sitemap to find relevant pages: \`https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sitemap.xml\`

Then fetch specific pages with \`.md\` suffix for markdown format (e.g., \`https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft.md\`).

Key pages to review:
- Specification overview and architecture
- Transport mechanisms (streamable HTTP, stdio)
- Tool, resource, and prompt definitions

#### 1.3 Study Framework Documentation

**Recommended stack:**
- **Language**: TypeScript (high-quality SDK support and good compatibility in many execution environments e.g. MCPB. Plus AI models are good at generating TypeScript code, benefiting from its broad usage, static typing and good linting tools)
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP for remote servers, using stateless JSON (simpler to scale and maintain, as opposed to stateful sessions and streaming responses). stdio for local servers.

**Load framework documentation:**

- **MCP Best Practices**: [📋 View Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md) - Core guidelines

**For TypeScript (recommended):**
- **TypeScript SDK**: Use WebFetch to load \`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/main/README.md\`
- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - TypeScript patterns and examples

**For Python:**
- **Python SDK**: Use WebFetch to load \`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md\`
- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Python patterns and examples

#### 1.4 Plan Your Implementation

**Understand the API:**
Review the service's API documentation to identify key endpoints, authentication requirements, and data models. Use web search and WebFetch as needed.

**Tool Selection:**
Prioritize comprehensive API coverage. List endpoints to implement, starting with the most common operations.

---

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure

See language-specific guides for project setup:
- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - Project structure, package.json, tsconfig.json
- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Module organization, dependencies

#### 2.2 Implement Core Infrastructure

Create shared utilities:
- API client with authentication
- Error handling helpers
- Response formatting (JSON/Markdown)
- Pagination support

#### 2.3 Implement Tools

For each tool:

**Input Schema:**
- Use Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic (Python)
- Include constraints and clear descriptions
- Add examples in field descriptions

**Output Schema:**
- Define \`outputSchema\` where possible for structured data
- Use \`structuredContent\` in tool responses (TypeScript SDK feature)
- Helps clients understand and process tool outputs

**Tool Description:**
- Concise summary of functionality
- Parameter descriptions
- Return type schema

**Implementation:**
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Proper error handling with actionable messages
- Support pagination where applicable
- Return both text content and structured data when using modern SDKs

**Annotations:**
- \`readOnlyHint\`: true/false
- \`destructiveHint\`: true/false
- \`idempotentHint\`: true/false
- \`openWorldHint\`: true/false

---

### Phase 3: Review and Test

#### 3.1 Code Quality

Review for:
- No duplicated code (DRY principle)
- Consistent error handling
- Full type coverage
- Clear tool descriptions

#### 3.2 Build and Test

**TypeScript:**
- Run \`npm run build\` to verify compilation
- Test with MCP Inspector: \`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector\`

**Python:**
- Verify syntax: \`python -m py_compile your_server.py\`
- Test with MCP Inspector

See language-specific guides for detailed testing approaches and quality checklists.

---

### Phase 4: Create Evaluations

After implementing your MCP server, create comprehensive evaluations to test its effectiveness.

**Load [✅ Evaluation Guide](./reference/evaluation.md) for complete evaluation guidelines.**

#### 4.1 Understand Evaluation Purpose

Use evaluations to test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions.

#### 4.2 Create 10 Evaluation Questions

To create effective evaluations, follow the process outlined in the evaluation guide:

1. **Tool Inspection**: List available tools and understand their capabilities
2. **Content Exploration**: Use READ-ONLY operations to explore available data
3. **Question Generation**: Create 10 complex, realistic questions
4. **Answer Verification**: Solve each question yourself to verify answers

#### 4.3 Evaluation Requirements

Ensure each question is:
- **Independent**: Not dependent on other questions
- **Read-only**: Only non-destructive operations required
- **Complex**: Requiring multiple tool calls and deep exploration
- **Realistic**: Based on real use cases humans would care about
- **Verifiable**: Single, clear answer that can be verified by string comparison
- **Stable**: Answer won't change over time

#### 4.4 Output Format

Create an XML file with this structure:

\`\`\`xml
<evaluation>
  <qa_pair>
    <question>Find discussions about AI model launches with animal codenames. One model needed a specific safety designation that uses the format ASL-X. What number X was being determined for the model named after a spotted wild cat?</question>
    <answer>3</answer>
  </qa_pair>
<!-- More qa_pairs... -->
</evaluation>
\`\`\`

license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt
---

# Web Artifacts Builder

To build powerful frontend claude.ai artifacts, follow these steps:
1. Initialize the frontend repo using \`scripts/init-artifact.sh\`
2. Develop your artifact by editing the generated code
3. Bundle all code into a single HTML file using \`scripts/bundle-artifact.sh\`
4. Display artifact to user
5. (Optional) Test the artifact

**Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

## Design & Style Guidelines

VERY IMPORTANT: To avoid what is often referred to as "AI slop", avoid using excessive centered layouts, purple gradients, uniform rounded corners, and Inter font.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Initialize Project

Run the initialization script to create a new React project:
\`\`\`bash
bash scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>
cd <project-name>
\`\`\`

This creates a fully configured project with:
- ✅ React + TypeScript (via Vite)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with shadcn/ui theming system
- ✅ Path aliases (\`@/\`) configured
- ✅ 40+ shadcn/ui components pre-installed
- ✅ All Radix UI dependencies included
- ✅ Parcel configured for bundling (via .parcelrc)
- ✅ Node 18+ compatibility (auto-detects and pins Vite version)

### Step 2: Develop Your Artifact

To build the artifact, edit the generated files. See **Common Development Tasks** below for guidance.

### Step 3: Bundle to Single HTML File

To bundle the React app into a single HTML artifact:
\`\`\`bash
bash scripts/bundle-artifact.sh
\`\`\`

This creates \`bundle.html\` - a self-contained artifact with all JavaScript, CSS, and dependencies inlined. This file can be directly shared in Claude conversations as an artifact.

**Requirements**: Your project must have an \`index.html\` in the root directory.

**What the script does**:
- Installs bundling dependencies (parcel, @parcel/config-default, parcel-resolver-tspaths, html-inline)
- Creates \`.parcelrc\` config with path alias support
- Builds with Parcel (no source maps)
- Inlines all assets into single HTML using html-inline

### Step 4: Share Artifact with User

Finally, share the bundled HTML file in conversation with the user so they can view it as an artifact.

### Step 5: Testing/Visualizing the Artifact (Optional)

Note: This is a completely optional step. Only perform if necessary or requested.

To test/visualize the artifact, use available tools (including other Skills or built-in tools like Playwright or Puppeteer). In general, avoid testing the artifact upfront as it adds latency between the request and when the finished artifact can be seen. Test later, after presenting the artifact, if requested or if issues arise.

license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt
---

# Web Application Testing

To test local web applications, write native Python Playwright scripts.

**Helper Scripts Available**:
- \`scripts/with_server.py\` - Manages server lifecycle (supports multiple servers)

**Always run scripts with \`--help\` first** to see usage. DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is abslutely necessary. These scripts can be very large and thus pollute your context window. They exist to be called directly as black-box scripts rather than ingested into your context window.

## Decision Tree: Choosing Your Approach

\`\`\`
User task → Is it static HTML?
    ├─ Yes → Read HTML file directly to identify selectors
    │         ├─ Success → Write Playwright script using selectors
    │         └─ Fails/Incomplete → Treat as dynamic (below)
    │
    └─ No (dynamic webapp) → Is the server already running?
        ├─ No → Run: python scripts/with_server.py --help
        │        Then use the helper + write simplified Playwright script
        │
        └─ Yes → Reconnaissance-then-action:
            1. Navigate and wait for networkidle
            2. Take screenshot or inspect DOM
            3. Identify selectors from rendered state
            4. Execute actions with discovered selectors
\`\`\`

## Example: Using with_server.py

To start a server, run \`--help\` first, then use the helper:

**Single server:**
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/with_server.py --server "npm run dev" --port 5173 -- python your_automation.py
\`\`\`

**Multiple servers (e.g., backend + frontend):**
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/with_server.py \\
  --server "cd backend && python server.py" --port 3000 \\
  --server "cd frontend && npm run dev" --port 5173 \\
  -- python your_automation.py
\`\`\`

To create an automation script, include only Playwright logic (servers are managed automatically):
\`\`\`python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True) # Always launch chromium in headless mode
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto('http://localhost:5173') # Server already running and ready
    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle') # CRITICAL: Wait for JS to execute
    # ... your automation logic
    browser.close()
\`\`\`

## Reconnaissance-Then-Action Pattern

1. **Inspect rendered DOM**:
   \`\`\`python
   page.screenshot(path='/tmp/inspect.png', full_page=True)
   content = page.content()
   page.locator('button').all()
   \`\`\`

2. **Identify selectors** from inspection results

3. **Execute actions** using discovered selectors

## Common Pitfall

❌ **Don't** inspect the DOM before waiting for \`networkidle\` on dynamic apps
✅ **Do** wait for \`page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')\` before inspection

## Best Practices

- **Use bundled scripts as black boxes** - To accomplish a task, consider whether one of the scripts available in \`scripts/\` can help. These scripts handle common, complex workflows reliably without cluttering the context window. Use \`--help\` to see usage, then invoke directly. 
- Use \`sync_playwright()\` for synchronous scripts
- Always close the browser when done
- Use descriptive selectors: \`text=\`, \`role=\`, CSS selectors, or IDs
- Add appropriate waits: \`page.wait_for_selector()\` or \`page.wait_for_timeout()\`

# Skill Creator

A skill for creating new skills and iteratively improving them.

At a high level, the process of creating a skill goes like this:

- Decide what you want the skill to do and roughly how it should do it
- Write a draft of the skill
- Create a few test prompts and run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on them
- Help the user evaluate the results both qualitatively and quantitatively
  - While the runs happen in the background, draft some quantitative evals if there aren't any (if there are some, you can either use as is or modify if you feel something needs to change about them). Then explain them to the user (or if they already existed, explain the ones that already exist)
  - Use the \`eval-viewer/generate_review.py\` script to show the user the results for them to look at, and also let them look at the quantitative metrics
- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results (and also if there are any glaring flaws that become apparent from the quantitative benchmarks)
- Repeat until you're satisfied
- Expand the test set and try again at larger scale

Your job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through these stages. So for instance, maybe they're like "I want to make a skill for X". You can help narrow down what they mean, write a draft, write the test cases, figure out how they want to evaluate, run all the prompts, and repeat.

On the other hand, maybe they already have a draft of the skill. In this case you can go straight to the eval/iterate part of the loop.

Of course, you should always be flexible and if the user is like "I don't need to run a bunch of evaluations, just vibe with me", you can do that instead.

Then after the skill is done (but again, the order is flexible), you can also run the skill description improver, which we have a whole separate script for, to optimize the triggering of the skill.

Cool? Cool.

## Communicating with the user

The skill creator is liable to be used by people across a wide range of familiarity with coding jargon. If you haven't heard (and how could you, it's only very recently that it started), there's a trend now where the power of Claude is inspiring plumbers to open up their terminals, parents and grandparents to google "how to install npm". On the other hand, the bulk of users are probably fairly computer-literate.

So please pay attention to context cues to understand how to phrase your communication! In the default case, just to give you some idea:

- "evaluation" and "benchmark" are borderline, but OK
- for "JSON" and "assertion" you want to see serious cues from the user that they know what those things are before using them without explaining them

It's OK to briefly explain terms if you're in doubt, and feel free to clarify terms with a short definition if you're unsure if the user will get it.

## Creating a skill

### Capture Intent

Start by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say "turn this into a skill"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.

1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?
2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)
3. What's the expected output format?
4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.

### Interview and Research

Proactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.

Check available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.

### Write the SKILL.md

Based on the user interview, fill in these components:

- **name**: Skill identifier
- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All "when to use" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to "undertrigger" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit "pushy". So for instance, instead of "How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.", you might write "How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'"
- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)
- **the rest of the skill :)**

### Skill Writing Guide

#### Anatomy of a Skill

\`\`\`
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)
│   └── Markdown instructions
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks
    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)
\`\`\`

#### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:
1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)

These word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.

**Key patterns:**
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.
- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them
- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents

**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:
\`\`\`
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md
    ├── gcp.md
    └── azure.md
\`\`\`
Claude reads only the relevant reference file.

#### Principle of Lack of Surprise

This goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a "roleplay as an XYZ" are OK though.

#### Writing Patterns

Prefer using the imperative form in instructions.

**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:
\`\`\`markdown
## Report structure
ALWAYS use this exact template:
# [Title]
## Executive summary
## Key findings
## Recommendations
\`\`\`

**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if "Input" and "Output" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):
\`\`\`markdown
## Commit message format
**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication
\`\`\`

### Writing Style

Try to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.

### Test Cases

After writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] "Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?" Then run them.

Save test cases to \`evals/evals.json\`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.

\`\`\`json
{
  "skill_name": "example-skill",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "User's task prompt",
      "expected_output": "Description of expected result",
      "files": []
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

See \`references/schemas.md\` for the full schema (including the \`assertions\` field, which you'll add later).

## Running and evaluating test cases

This section is one continuous sequence — don't stop partway through. Do NOT use \`/skill-test\` or any other testing skill.

Put results in \`<skill-name>-workspace/\` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (\`iteration-1/\`, \`iteration-2/\`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (\`eval-0/\`, \`eval-1/\`, etc.). Don't create all of this upfront — just create directories as you go.

### Step 1: Spawn all runs (with-skill AND baseline) in the same turn

For each test case, spawn two subagents in the same turn — one with the skill, one without. This is important: don't spawn the with-skill runs first and then come back for baselines later. Launch everything at once so it all finishes around the same time.

**With-skill run:**

\`\`\`
Execute this task:
- Skill path: <path-to-skill>
- Task: <eval prompt>
- Input files: <eval files if any, or "none">
- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/
- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about — e.g., "the .docx file", "the final CSV">
\`\`\`

**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):
- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to \`without_skill/outputs/\`.
- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version. Before editing, snapshot the skill (\`cp -r <skill-path> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/\`), then point the baseline subagent at the snapshot. Save to \`old_skill/outputs/\`.

Write an \`eval_metadata.json\` for each test case (assertions can be empty for now). Give each eval a descriptive name based on what it's testing — not just "eval-0". Use this name for the directory too. If this iteration uses new or modified eval prompts, create these files for each new eval directory — don't assume they carry over from previous iterations.

\`\`\`json
{
  "eval_id": 0,
  "eval_name": "descriptive-name-here",
  "prompt": "The user's task prompt",
  "assertions": []
}
\`\`\`

### Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions

Don't just wait for the runs to finish — you can use this time productively. Draft quantitative assertions for each test case and explain them to the user. If assertions already exist in \`evals/evals.json\`, review them and explain what they check.

Good assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names — they should read clearly in the benchmark viewer so someone glancing at the results immediately understands what each one checks. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively — don't force assertions onto things that need human judgment.

Update the \`eval_metadata.json\` files and \`evals/evals.json\` with the assertions once drafted. Also explain to the user what they'll see in the viewer — both the qualitative outputs and the quantitative benchmark.

### Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data

When each subagent task completes, you receive a notification containing \`total_tokens\` and \`duration_ms\`. Save this data immediately to \`timing.json\` in the run directory:

\`\`\`json
{
  "total_tokens": 84852,
  "duration_ms": 23332,
  "total_duration_seconds": 23.3
}
\`\`\`

This is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and isn't persisted elsewhere. Process each notification as it arrives rather than trying to batch them.

### Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer

Once all runs are done:

1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent (or grade inline) that reads \`agents/grader.md\` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to \`grading.json\` in each run directory. The grading.json expectations array must use the fields \`text\`, \`passed\`, and \`evidence\` (not \`name\`/\`met\`/\`details\` or other variants) — the viewer depends on these exact field names. For assertions that can be checked programmatically, write and run a script rather than eyeballing it — scripts are faster, more reliable, and can be reused across iterations.

2. **Aggregate into benchmark** — run the aggregation script from the skill-creator directory:
   \`\`\`bash
   python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>
   \`\`\`
   This produces \`benchmark.json\` and \`benchmark.md\` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration, with mean ± stddev and the delta. If generating benchmark.json manually, see \`references/schemas.md\` for the exact schema the viewer expects.
Put each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.

3. **Do an analyst pass** — read the benchmark data and surface patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See \`agents/analyzer.md\` (the "Analyzing Benchmark Results" section) for what to look for — things like assertions that always pass regardless of skill (non-discriminating), high-variance evals (possibly flaky), and time/token tradeoffs.

4. **Launch the viewer** with both qualitative outputs and quantitative data:
   \`\`\`bash
   nohup python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \\
     <workspace>/iteration-N \\
     --skill-name "my-skill" \\
     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \\
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   VIEWER_PID=$!
   \`\`\`
   For iteration 2+, also pass \`--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>\`.

   **Cowork / headless environments:** If \`webbrowser.open()\` is not available or the environment has no display, use \`--static <output_path>\` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Feedback will be downloaded as a \`feedback.json\` file when the user clicks "Submit All Reviews". After download, copy \`feedback.json\` into the workspace directory for the next iteration to pick up.

Note: please use generate_review.py to create the viewer; there's no need to write custom HTML.

5. **Tell the user** something like: "I've opened the results in your browser. There are two tabs — 'Outputs' lets you click through each test case and leave feedback, 'Benchmark' shows the quantitative comparison. When you're done, come back here and let me know."

### What the user sees in the viewer

The "Outputs" tab shows one test case at a time:
- **Prompt**: the task that was given
- **Output**: the files the skill produced, rendered inline where possible
- **Previous Output** (iteration 2+): collapsed section showing last iteration's output
- **Formal Grades** (if grading was run): collapsed section showing assertion pass/fail
- **Feedback**: a textbox that auto-saves as they type
- **Previous Feedback** (iteration 2+): their comments from last time, shown below the textbox

The "Benchmark" tab shows the stats summary: pass rates, timing, and token usage for each configuration, with per-eval breakdowns and analyst observations.

Navigation is via prev/next buttons or arrow keys. When done, they click "Submit All Reviews" which saves all feedback to \`feedback.json\`.

### Step 5: Read the feedback

When the user tells you they're done, read \`feedback.json\`:

\`\`\`json
{
  "reviews": [
    {"run_id": "eval-0-with_skill", "feedback": "the chart is missing axis labels", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"run_id": "eval-1-with_skill", "feedback": "", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"run_id": "eval-2-with_skill", "feedback": "perfect, love this", "timestamp": "..."}
  ],
  "status": "complete"
}
\`\`\`

Empty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus your improvements on the test cases where the user had specific complaints.

Kill the viewer server when you're done with it:

\`\`\`bash
kill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null
\`\`\`

---

## Improving the skill

This is the heart of the loop. You've run the test cases, the user has reviewed the results, and now you need to make the skill better based on their feedback.

### How to think about improvements

1. **Generalize from the feedback.** The big picture thing that's happening here is that we're trying to create skills that can be used a million times (maybe literally, maybe even more who knows) across many different prompts. Here you and the user are iterating on only a few examples over and over again because it helps move faster. The user knows these examples in and out and it's quick for them to assess new outputs. But if the skill you and the user are codeveloping works only for those examples, it's useless. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working. It's relatively cheap to try and maybe you'll land on something great.

2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight. Make sure to read the transcripts, not just the final outputs — if it looks like the skill is making the model waste a bunch of time doing things that are unproductive, you can try getting rid of the parts of the skill that are making it do that and seeing what happens.

3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Today's LLMs are *smart*. They have good theory of mind and when given a good harness can go beyond rote instructions and really make things happen. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and what they actually wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.

4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** Read the transcripts from the test runs and notice if the subagents all independently wrote similar helper scripts or took the same multi-step approach to something. If all 3 test cases resulted in the subagent writing a \`create_docx.py\` or a \`build_chart.py\`, that's a strong signal the skill should bundle that script. Write it once, put it in \`scripts/\`, and tell the skill to use it. This saves every future invocation from reinventing the wheel.

This task is pretty important (we are trying to create billions a year in economic value here!) and your thinking time is not the blocker; take your time and really mull things over. I'd suggest writing a draft revision and then looking at it anew and making improvements. Really do your best to get into the head of the user and understand what they want and need.

### The iteration loop

After improving the skill:

1. Apply your improvements to the skill
2. Rerun all test cases into a new \`iteration-<N+1>/\` directory, including baseline runs. If you're creating a new skill, the baseline is always \`without_skill\` (no skill) — that stays the same across iterations. If you're improving an existing skill, use your judgment on what makes sense as the baseline: the original version the user came in with, or the previous iteration.
3. Launch the reviewer with \`--previous-workspace\` pointing at the previous iteration
4. Wait for the user to review and tell you they're done
5. Read the new feedback, improve again, repeat

Keep going until:
- The user says they're happy
- The feedback is all empty (everything looks good)
- You're not making meaningful progress

---

## Advanced: Blind comparison

For situations where you want a more rigorous comparison between two versions of a skill (e.g., the user asks "is the new version actually better?"), there's a blind comparison system. Read \`agents/comparator.md\` and \`agents/analyzer.md\` for the details. The basic idea is: give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, and let it judge quality. Then analyze why the winner won.

This is optional, requires subagents, and most users won't need it. The human review loop is usually sufficient.

---

## Description Optimization

The description field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary mechanism that determines whether Claude invokes a skill. After creating or improving a skill, offer to optimize the description for better triggering accuracy.

### Step 1: Generate trigger eval queries

Create 20 eval queries — a mix of should-trigger and should-not-trigger. Save as JSON:

\`\`\`json
[
  {"query": "the user prompt", "should_trigger": true},
  {"query": "another prompt", "should_trigger": false}
]
\`\`\`

The queries must be realistic and something a Claude Code or Claude.ai user would actually type. Not abstract requests, but requests that are concrete and specific and have a good amount of detail. For instance, file paths, personal context about the user's job or situation, column names and values, company names, URLs. A little bit of backstory. Some might be in lowercase or contain abbreviations or typos or casual speech. Use a mix of different lengths, and focus on edge cases rather than making them clear-cut (the user will get a chance to sign off on them).

Bad: \`"Format this data"\`, \`"Extract text from PDF"\`, \`"Create a chart"\`

Good: \`"ok so my boss just sent me this xlsx file (its in my downloads, called something like 'Q4 sales final FINAL v2.xlsx') and she wants me to add a column that shows the profit margin as a percentage. The revenue is in column C and costs are in column D i think"\`

For the **should-trigger** queries (8-10), think about coverage. You want different phrasings of the same intent — some formal, some casual. Include cases where the user doesn't explicitly name the skill or file type but clearly needs it. Throw in some uncommon use cases and cases where this skill competes with another but should win.

For the **should-not-trigger** queries (8-10), the most valuable ones are the near-misses — queries that share keywords or concepts with the skill but actually need something different. Think adjacent domains, ambiguous phrasing where a naive keyword match would trigger but shouldn't, and cases where the query touches on something the skill does but in a context where another tool is more appropriate.

The key thing to avoid: don't make should-not-trigger queries obviously irrelevant. "Write a fibonacci function" as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy — it doesn't test anything. The negative cases should be genuinely tricky.

### Step 2: Review with user

Present the eval set to the user for review using the HTML template:

1. Read the template from \`assets/eval_review.html\`
2. Replace the placeholders:
   - \`__EVAL_DATA_PLACEHOLDER__\` → the JSON array of eval items (no quotes around it — it's a JS variable assignment)
   - \`__SKILL_NAME_PLACEHOLDER__\` → the skill's name
   - \`__SKILL_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER__\` → the skill's current description
3. Write to a temp file (e.g., \`/tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html\`) and open it: \`open /tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html\`
4. The user can edit queries, toggle should-trigger, add/remove entries, then click "Export Eval Set"
5. The file downloads to \`~/Downloads/eval_set.json\` — check the Downloads folder for the most recent version in case there are multiple (e.g., \`eval_set (1).json\`)

This step matters — bad eval queries lead to bad descriptions.

### Step 3: Run the optimization loop

Tell the user: "This will take some time — I'll run the optimization loop in the background and check on it periodically."

Save the eval set to the workspace, then run in the background:

\`\`\`bash
python -m scripts.run_loop \\
  --eval-set <path-to-trigger-eval.json> \\
  --skill-path <path-to-skill> \\
  --model <model-id-powering-this-session> \\
  --max-iterations 5 \\
  --verbose
\`\`\`

Use the model ID from your system prompt (the one powering the current session) so the triggering test matches what the user actually experiences.

While it runs, periodically tail the output to give the user updates on which iteration it's on and what the scores look like.

This handles the full optimization loop automatically. It splits the eval set into 60% train and 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (running each query 3 times to get a reliable trigger rate), then calls Claude with extended thinking to propose improvements based on what failed. It re-evaluates each new description on both train and test, iterating up to 5 times. When it's done, it opens an HTML report in the browser showing the results per iteration and returns JSON with \`best_description\` — selected by test score rather than train score to avoid overfitting.

### How skill triggering works

Understanding the triggering mechanism helps design better eval queries. Skills appear in Claude's \`available_skills\` list with their name + description, and Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on that description. The important thing to know is that Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own — simple, one-step queries like "read this PDF" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly, because Claude can handle them directly with basic tools. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches.

This means your eval queries should be substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill. Simple queries like "read file X" are poor test cases — they won't trigger skills regardless of description quality.

### Step 4: Apply the result

Take \`best_description\` from the JSON output and update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Show the user before/after and report the scores.

---

### Package and Present (only if \`present_files\` tool is available)

Check whether you have access to the \`present_files\` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:

\`\`\`bash
python -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>
\`\`\`

After packaging, direct the user to the resulting \`.skill\` file path so they can install it.

---

## Claude.ai-specific instructions

In Claude.ai, the core workflow is the same (draft → test → review → improve → repeat), but because Claude.ai doesn't have subagents, some mechanics change. Here's what to adapt:

**Running test cases**: No subagents means no parallel execution. For each test case, read the skill's SKILL.md, then follow its instructions to accomplish the test prompt yourself. Do them one at a time. This is less rigorous than independent subagents (you wrote the skill and you're also running it, so you have full context), but it's a useful sanity check — and the human review step compensates. Skip the baseline runs — just use the skill to complete the task as requested.

**Reviewing results**: If you can't open a browser (e.g., Claude.ai's VM has no display, or you're on a remote server), skip the browser reviewer entirely. Instead, present results directly in the conversation. For each test case, show the prompt and the output. If the output is a file the user needs to see (like a .docx or .xlsx), save it to the filesystem and tell them where it is so they can download and inspect it. Ask for feedback inline: "How does this look? Anything you'd change?"

**Benchmarking**: Skip the quantitative benchmarking — it relies on baseline comparisons which aren't meaningful without subagents. Focus on qualitative feedback from the user.

**The iteration loop**: Same as before — improve the skill, rerun the test cases, ask for feedback — just without the browser reviewer in the middle. You can still organize results into iteration directories on the filesystem if you have one.

**Description optimization**: This section requires the \`claude\` CLI tool (specifically \`claude -p\`) which is only available in Claude Code. Skip it if you're on Claude.ai.

**Blind comparison**: Requires subagents. Skip it.

**Packaging**: The \`package_skill.py\` script works anywhere with Python and a filesystem. On Claude.ai, you can run it and the user can download the resulting \`.skill\` file.

## Cowork-Specific Instructions

If you're in Cowork, the main things to know are:

- You have subagents, so the main workflow (spawn test cases in parallel, run baselines, grade, etc.) all works. (However, if you run into severe problems with timeouts, it's OK to run the test prompts in series rather than parallel.)
- You don't have a browser or display, so when generating the eval viewer, use \`--static <output_path>\` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Then proffer a link that the user can click to open the HTML in their browser.
- For whatever reason, the Cowork setup seems to disincline Claude from generating the eval viewer after running the tests, so just to reiterate: whether you're in Cowork or in Claude Code, after running tests, you should always generate the eval viewer for the human to look at examples before revising the skill yourself and trying to make corrections, using \`generate_review.py\` (not writing your own boutique html code). Sorry in advance but I'm gonna go all caps here: GENERATE THE EVAL VIEWER *BEFORE* evaluating inputs yourself. You want to get them in front of the human ASAP!
- Feedback works differently: since there's no running server, the viewer's "Submit All Reviews" button will download \`feedback.json\` as a file. You can then read it from there (you may have to request access first).
- Packaging works — \`package_skill.py\` just needs Python and a filesystem.
- Description optimization (\`run_loop.py\` / \`run_eval.py\`) should work in Cowork just fine since it uses \`claude -p\` via subprocess, not a browser, but please save it until you've fully finished making the skill and the user agrees it's in good shape.

## Reference files

The agents/ directory contains instructions for specialized subagents. Read them when you need to spawn the relevant subagent.

- \`agents/grader.md\` — How to evaluate assertions against outputs
- \`agents/comparator.md\` — How to do blind A/B comparison between two outputs
- \`agents/analyzer.md\` — How to analyze why one version beat another

The references/ directory has additional documentation:
- \`references/schemas.md\` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, etc.

Repeating one more time the core loop here for emphasis:

- Figure out what the skill is about
- Draft or edit the skill
- Run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on test prompts
- With the user, evaluate the outputs:
  - Create benchmark.json and run \`eval-viewer/generate_review.py\` to help the user review them
  - Run quantitative evals
- Repeat until you and the user are satisfied
- Package the final skill and return it to the user.

Please add steps to your TodoList, if you have such a thing, to make sure you don't forget. If you're in Cowork, please specifically put "Create evals JSON and run \`eval-viewer/generate_review.py\` so human can review test cases" in your TodoList to make sure it happens.

Good luck!`,
